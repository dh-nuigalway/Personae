<head>Irregular, Doubtful, and Emended <lb/>Accidentals in <siglum>F1</siglum></head>

<p>The following emendations made in the Variorum text correct obvious typographical irregularities in <siglum>F1</siglum>. Mistakes that produce English words are not recorded here, but they are in the historical collation. In each note the lemma is the emended Variorum reading, and the first siglum is that of the source from which the emendation is drawn, followed by the rejected <siglum>F1</siglum> reading.</p>

<p>Though there has been spotty resistance to attributing all of <title level="m">Err.</title> to Sh., the consensus is that he wrote it as we have it in F. The following raise doubts:</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ritj0001"><name type="app">Ritson</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1793"><name type="app">Steevens</name></ref>, ed. 1793, 7:209): <quote>This comedy though boasting the embellishments of our author’s genius, in additional words, lines, speeches, and scenes, was not originally his, but proceeded from some inferior playwright, who was capable of reading the <title level="m">Menæchmi</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1793"><name type="app">Steevens</name></ref> (ed. 1793, 7:316): <quote>On a careful revision of the foregoing scenes [he apparently refers to the whole play], I do not hesitate to pronounce them the composition of two very unequal writers. Shakspeare had undoubtedly a share in them; but that the entire play was no work of his, is an opinion which (as Benedick says): <quote>fire cannot melt out of me; I will die in it at the stake.</quote></quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1821"><name type="app">Boswell</name></ref> (ed. 1821, 1:15), transcribing <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pope1"><name type="app">Pope</name></ref>’s preface (ed. 1725, 1:xx): <quote>And I should conjecture of some of the others (particularly Love’s Labour’s Lost, The Winter’s Tale, Comedy of Errors, and Titus Andronicus,) that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few particular passages, were of his hand.</quote> Pope does not include <title level="m">Err.</title>; whether it was added by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_male0001"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> or Boswell is not known.</p>

<p>This mistake is noted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_eict1903"><name type="app">Eichhoff</name></ref> (1903, p. 32 n.), who, however, accepts <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pope1"><name type="app">Pope</name></ref>’s notion that all the plays printed in F suffer from an accretion of actors’ additions to the playhouse manuscripts over a period of years. Thus Pope accounts for much of what he thought was unworthy of Sh. Eichhoff attempts to locate and account for all such <quote>interpolations</quote> in <title level="m">Err.</title> He ascribes 366 lines to this or these interpolators, including much of the low comedy of the Dromios and all the Courtesan’s lines, as having been added to please the populace. It is, for example, unthinkable that distinguished citizens such as Adriana and the Duke would be seen talking to a prostitute in the streets.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0005">Other critics who believe that Sh. adapted an earlier play include <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_olie1908"><name type="app">Oliphant</name></ref> (1909, p. 349); <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1922, p. 77; withdrawn ed. 1962, p. 65); and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_robj1923"><name type="app">Robertson</name></ref> (1923, p. 127), who writes: <quote>That any one should ever have seen a Shakespearean touch in any of it is a monition to us of the difficulty which faces every attempt to modify the temper of traditionism</quote> [he thinks Marlowe wrote the blank verse sections of <title level="m">Err.</title>]; and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref> (<title level="a">Evolution,</title> 1926), who thinks that Kyd was responsible for part of the play and that Sh. wrote the Luciana sections.</p>

<p>The following anti-Stratfordians attribute <title level="m">Err.</title> to various figures: <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ther1901"><name type="app">Theobald</name></ref> (1901, passim) to Bacon; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stoj1904"><name type="app">Stotsenburg</name></ref> (1904, pp. 474–7) to Dekker; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hofc1955"><name type="app">Hoffman</name></ref> (1955, p. 266) to Marlowe; the <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ogbd1962"><name type="app">Ogburn</name>s</ref> (1962, pp. 250, 257) to Oxford; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sweg1965"><name type="app">Sweet</name></ref> (1965, p. 95) to Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>(In <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1955"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> [1955, p. 59]; Doctor Thomas Worrall was one of the Bishop of London’s censors. Greg prints a facsimile as the frontispiece to <title level="m">A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration</title>, vol. 1, 1939.)</p>

<p><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> was almost certainly printed for the first time in the First Folio, sigs. H1–I2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>. <title level="m">Err.</title> is printed on pages 85–100 of <siglum>F1</siglum>, misnumbering 86 as 88, TLNs 0–1919.</p>

<p>Compositor C set pages 85–88<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> (=86), TLNs 0–164; 87<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>–89<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>,TLNs 289–549; 91<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>,TLNs 743–808; 94<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, TLNs 1235–54.</p>

<p>Compositor D set pages 88<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>(=86), TLNs 165–288; 89<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>–90, TLNs 550–742; 91<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>,TLNs 809–74; 94<hi rend="superscript">a–b</hi> through 1234, TLNs 1128–1234.</p>

<p>Compositor B set pages 92–93, TLNs 875–1127; 95–100, TLNs 1255–1919. No quarto is known. It is the fifth of the comedies. The first four were printed from transcripts made by Ralph Crane, and the next four, <title level="m">Ado</title>, <title level="m">LLL</title>, <title level="m">MND</title>, and <title level="m">MV</title> were printed from quarto copy. Since <title level="m">Err.</title> was probably printed from Sh.’s foul papers (argued in detail below), Jaggard’s compositors encountered Sh.’s handwriting for the first time in setting <title level="m">Err.</title>, which may account for some of the mistakes in the text. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1922, p. 65) raises the question of whether <siglum>F1</siglum> was set from a quarto because he finds no instances of what he thinks were characteristic Shn. spellings, which would, he says, have been smoothed out by earlier compositors, but he dismisses the possibility in favor of his theory that copy for F involved dictation and annotation (see below). The folios of 1632, 1663–4, and 1685 copied each other in succession without recourse to other printed or manuscript copy.</p>

<p>The play is divided into acts but not into scenes save for <hi rend="italic">Scena prima</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Prima</hi> for all but Act 2.

Evidence of type batter indicates that the first reading listed is the uncorrected state. In variant copies 64 and 79 [imperfect copies of F not collated by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref>] and in four other copies (16, 43, 56, 68), the <quote>h</quote> of <quote>the</quote> in H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>b63 is undamaged, but in all other copies it is damaged. Clearly then copies 64 and 79 were among the first copies of H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>:5 to be printed and they preserve the earlier, uncorrected state of the forme. Proofreading of H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> must have been unusually prompt, for only two of eighty-two Folger copies of the page show the uncorrected state.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> (1963, 2:389–92), using evidence drawn from rules, the misnumbering of p. 86 as 88, and the patterns of recurring distinctive type, demonstrates that quire H was set in the normal Folio fashion, that is, set by formes from the innermost to the outermost type pages, from cast-off copy, by compositors setting forme pages simultaneously. Quire I was set out of normal sequence (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963">ibid.</ref> 2:395–7): I3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>:4, I3:4<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, I1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>:6, I2:5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, I1:6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, I2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>:5, where I3–I6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> contain <title level="m">Ado</title>. Hinman has no explanation for this odd order of setting. Compositors C, D, and B set the play.</p>

<p>Each compositor normally set from his own type case and distributed the pages he had set; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> calls these cases x, y, and z. He makes this analysis by observing the recurrence of battered individual types in successive formes and by charting the order of setting and of distributing the types back into their type cases (for <title level="m">Err.</title>, 2:388–97). He correctly assigns B’s pages but is uncertain about a few pages he thinks were set by Compositor D: H3, H2, H1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, and H1. He proved to be wrong about H4<hi rend="superscript">b</hi> and H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> as well. Further analysis by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1973), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1975"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref> (1975), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1982"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1982) has apparently settled the compositors’ stints. I use Werstine’s case designations (r, s, t) because Hinman could not identify the cases correctly until quire I. Formes in parentheses indicate the setting of <title level="m">Ado</title>.</p>

<p>Once <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> had determined the order of printing and made what compositorial assignments he could, others turned to solving the questions he candidly raised, especially about printing the comedies, undertaken in Jaggard’s printing house simultaneously with the printing of Thomas Wilson’s <title level="m">Christian Dictionary</title> (1622) (1:343–6).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mckd1984 #b_mckd1969"><name type="app">McKenzie</name></ref> (1969 and 1984) has attacked the enterprise of inferring much about the order of printing as detailed by Hinman, or detecting spacing preferences such as Howard-Hill and others have done. He in turn has been opposed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jacm1987"><name type="app">Jackson</name></ref> (1987) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tang1991"><name type="app">Tanselle</name></ref> (1991), who judge that the force of corroborative evidence of various kinds brings assurance of validity.</p>

<p>The work on the compositors done by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wile1932"><name type="app">Willoughby</name></ref> (1932), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wala1953"><name type="app">Walker</name></ref> (1953), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> (1963) was refined by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1973), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1975"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref> (1975), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_reis1976"><name type="app">Reid</name></ref> (1976), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1982"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1982), who have settled the stints of these three in <title level="m">Err.</title> The earlier spelling tests showed Compositor B’s preference for spelling <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, <hi rend="italic">heere</hi>. His reputation as a bad typesetter of Sh.’s plays (Walker) has been rehabilitated by Werstine, and now he is regarded as one of the best who worked on F. Reid expands the list of B’s spelling preferences. Hinman (1:193–6) first identifies Compositor C as a <hi rend="italic">doe</hi>, <hi rend="italic">goe</hi>, <hi rend="italic">here</hi> speller, and (1:196–7) Compositor D as one who slightly prefers <hi rend="italic">doe</hi>-<hi rend="italic">goe</hi> to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>-<hi rend="italic">go</hi>, and strongly prefers <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> expands the typesetting habits beyond <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wala1953"><name type="app">Walker</name></ref>’s simple spelling tests. He adds to the list of spelling preferences and shows that compositors treated spaced and unspaced commas in short lines and at the ends of lines in distinguishable ways. He also (p. 71) notices that <quote>there are occasions on which compositors, obliged to turn over a line of verse which was too long for their measure, and unable or unwilling to set it as a turn-down or turn-up at the right margin of the column, have carried the remaining part of the line on to the next line. Often these have been indented from the left-hand margin.</quote> These lines he calls <quote>indented turn-overs.</quote> He gives the following table of indented turnovers up to <title level="m">WT</title>:

<table xml:id="table_app_002" rows="3" cols="4">
<row role="label">
<cell role="label">Compositor</cell>
<cell>B</cell>
<cell>C</cell>
<cell>D</cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell role="label">Pages set</cell>

</row>

<row>
<cell role="label">Occurrences</cell>
<cell>20</cell>
<cell>2</cell>
<cell>94</cell>
</row>
</table>

On the basis of these preferences, he says (p. 72): <quote>It is therefore more likely than not that any page with more than one such indented turn-over was set by compositor D, and it is very unlikely to have been set by&hellip;C.</quote></p>

<p>These preferences show Compositor C at work in quire H on columns <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> is unsure about (H3<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, H2<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, H1<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, H1<hi rend="superscript">a and b</hi>) and correct <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref>’s attribution of H4 and H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> from Compositor D to Compositors C and D. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> does not use damaged-type evidence to corroborate his spelling or psychomechanical evidence such as spacing, but his expansion of typesetting habits greatly improves identification of compositors and their stints.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1975"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref> accepts <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref>’s reassignments except for H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (he assigns it to Compositor C, not <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref>’s and Howard-Hill’s D) and the last twenty lines of H5<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi> (which he assigns also to Compositor C, not D). He usefully invents (p. 89) the term <quote>indented flow-over</quote> for Howard-Hill’s <quote>indented turn-overs.</quote> Despite D’s clear preference for indented flow-overs—36 on H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>—O’Connor assigns H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> to C because he finds C’s preferred <hi rend="italic">you’ll</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0663">663</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0692">692</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0702">702</ref>) and the contractions <hi rend="italic">y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi></hi>, <hi rend="italic">y<hi rend="superscript">u</hi></hi>, <hi rend="italic">y<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></hi> on that page; he accounts for the flow-overs as the result of <quote>tumbling-verse dialogue [in H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and L6–L6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>], where little or no room exists for a turn-over</quote> (p. 90). This assignment of all H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> has not been generally accepted, but that of H5<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1235" targetEnd="#tln_1254">1235–54</ref> to Compositor C has been. There O’Connor (pp. 112–13) finds <hi rend="italic">gon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wee’ll</hi>, C preferences, as well as a failure to fill out line <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1234">1234</ref> with a short <hi rend="italic">And</hi> for which there is room; he compares <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1200">1200</ref>, where <hi rend="italic">but</hi> fills the line, and he argues that between <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1234">1234</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1235">1235</ref> something caused Compositor C to replace D. Like Howard-Hill, O’Connor expands the number and range of spelling preferences that help identify individual compositors; like him, O’Connor does not use battered-type evidence to support his spelling preferences.</p>

<p>It remained for <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1982"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1982) to test <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref>’s battered-type tables to see whether they could corroborate the newly assigned compositorial stints of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1975"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref>. Hinman, believing that only two compositors set quire H (but open to the possibility that one or more other workmen participated in setting the quire), is puzzled by observing that types from the upper and lower portions of a preceding type page recur in the work of compositors different from the ones who set the preceding page; this means that compositors distributed parts of the same type pages, in a way unlike the normal Folio practice—normal after a few more quires had been set—of each compositor’s distributing only his own pages. Werstine, using the types identified by Hinman, confirms or slightly changes the stints analyzed by Howard-Hill and O’Connor; he shows that in fact from the beginning of Folio setting, three type cases were employed, the ones Hinman only firmly locates as beginning in quire K.</p>

<p>Case differentiation settles the <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref>–<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1975"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref> assignments of H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (Compositor D) and lower H5<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi> (Compositor C). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1982"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> points out that, because no forme in quire H was set entirely by a single compositor, <quote>each forme provided an opportunity for simultaneous composition by at least two workmen and sometimes by all three</quote> (p. 212; he judges that all but H2:5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>:4 underwent some degree of simultaneous composition).</p>

<p>He draws (p. 234) <quote>two major implications for editors and textual critics of the early Folio comedies. The first deals with cast-off copy for quires G and H. Ordinarily, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hinc1963"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> observed, when a quire was set in normal Folio printing order, there was need to cast off copy only for the first half of the quire, since the pages of the second half were set in their reading sequence [4–6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>].&hellip;However, simultaneous composition of successive formes of a quire—possible for quire G, probable for quire H—would have necessitated casting off copy for both halves of the quire so that compositors could work concurrently from separate blocks of copy to set pages of the second half of the quire. Thus editors must be wary of compositorial attempts to stretch or squeeze the texts of <title level="m">MM</title> and <title level="m">Err.</title> into the space available. One such attempt is evident in the last half of quire H at the bottom of H5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>b, set by Compositor C, and the top of H6a, set simultaneously by Compositor B, where verse is compressed into prose. Second, identification of cases x, y, and z [his former r, s, t] in quires G–I confirms attribution of pages in these quires to Compositors B, C, D, and F. Editors of the Folio Comedies may then have greater confidence in using the available studies of compositorial accuracy in arriving at judgments about when and how to emend.</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp2001"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> [2001], doubts that Compositor F, supposed to have set pages of the four comedies preceding <title level="m">Err.</title> from Ralph Crane copy, can be differentiated from Compositor D, i.e., he does not exist.)</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp2001"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref>’s example of <quote>verse compressed into prose</quote> on H5<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>–H6<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> is weakened by observing how erratic that verse is (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1254" targetEnd="#tln_1258">1254–8</ref>; what did the compositors see in their copy? <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1254-01">see n.</ref>), and how much white space appears in the SDs on H6. The evidence of compression on H5<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi> is the turnunder of (<hi rend="italic">sup</hi>|<hi rend="italic">ping</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1248" targetEnd="#tln_1249">1248–9</ref>)—one of only three turnunders in the entire play, one by each compositor—and, in the last line of the column, no space between the SP and the first line of a prose-lined speech, which is squeezed in when the last word <hi rend="italic">naile</hi> might have been set on the next page. However, Compositor B’s H6<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> shows no sign of compression carrying over from H5<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>. As Werstine argues, Compositor B was probably setting H6 simultaneously from cast-off copy, leaving Compositor C to make all the necessary adjustments to get his allotted text into his type pages; nothing about the difficulty of reading printer’s copy can be inferred from how B set the top of H6.</p>

<p>Because the compositors are setting from Sh.’s MS for the first time, how they punctuated their stints proves interesting. If Hand D of <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi> is really Sh.’s, he punctuated very lightly; indeed, fewer than 20 marks appear in the type facsimile in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_evns"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref> (ed. 1974, pp. 1686–96). Such light pointing would impede reading comprehension, so when such copy came to the printing house, it <quote><hi rend="italic">is look’d on as a task and duty incumbent on the</hi> Compositor, <hi rend="italic">viz. to discern and emend the bad</hi> Spelling <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Pointing <hi rend="italic">of his Copy</hi></quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_moxj1683"><name type="app">Moxon</name></ref>, 1683–4; 1962, p. 192). Moxon goes on to say (p. 215): <quote>As he <hi rend="italic">Sets</hi> on, he considers how to <hi rend="italic">Point</hi> his Work, viz. when to <hi rend="italic">Set</hi> , where ; where : and where&hellip;. But the Rules for these having been taught in many School-books, I need say nothing to them here, but refer you to them.</quote> If Sh. carefully punctuated <title level="m">Err.</title>, we would expect the compositors to follow his punctuation in such matters as the use of colons, semicolons, periods, and capitalization after midline question marks and periods; they were expected to follow good copy <quote><hi rend="italic">strictly</hi></quote> (p. 192). In too lightly pointed copy, however, they were to make sense of the text. What happens is that each compositor treats the pointing differently. I do not mean that each compositor parses his text in a distinguishable way but rather that each shows preferences in his choice of punctuation marks. The following chart shows how each compositor handles colons and semicolons between the beginning and the end of verse lines and within prose passages; how frequently each capitalized after internal question marks; and how often each capitalized after an internal period. The relative lack of midline punctuation in the figures below reflects the fact that in Sh.’s early blank verse the clause and the metrical line coincide most of the time.</p>

<p>There is little difference in the punctuating styles of Compositors C and D, but Compositor B is different from them in the clause break: category and especially so in his following an internal period with a capital letter. It may be that Sh.’s own punctuation was more nearly like C’s and D’s.</p>

<p>The charts below show the total SPs for the major speaking roles (Chart 1) and the SPs for the Antipholuses in the order in which the type pages were set (Chart 2).</p>

<p>The compositors set from cast-off copy, setting H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>–H4 first; that is, they started at Act 3; then Compositors C and D went backwards to the beginning of the play, and Compositor B went forwards to the end, save for H5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, which was set by the other two.</p>

<p>In this play with two Dromios and two Antipholuses, keeping the Ephesians and the Syracusans straight is useful, especially for a reader. So when D and C begin setting (H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> for D, H4<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> for C), they distinguish, though not consistently, which Antipholus and which Dromio is speaking. They probably had some guidance from their copy, but they apparently choose the form of the SP. Compositor D sets <hi rend="italic">E. Anti.</hi>, <hi rend="italic">E. Ant.</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">E. An.</hi> 5 times (all in column a), and plain <hi rend="italic">Anti.</hi> 3 times and <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> once. By column b he has settled on <hi rend="italic">Anti.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> He distinguishes between <hi rend="italic">E.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S.</hi> Dromio in 26 prefixes. When he sets H4<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, however, he sets <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> 9 times after an initial <hi rend="italic">S. Anti.</hi>, and one <hi rend="italic">S. Dro.</hi> to two <hi rend="italic">Dro.</hi> Compositor C, setting column a, sets only <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anti.</hi> (He also sets <hi rend="italic">Iuliana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Iulia.</hi>, apparently unable to read Sh.’s indication that Luciana enters and speaks. He gets the names right thereafter.) As C continues to set his pages, however, he always but thrice (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0352">352</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0355">355</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0358">358</ref>) sets <hi rend="italic">E.

<p>The Antipholuses are treated differently. They are hardly ever distinguished, as for example on H2<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>, where Compositor C sets 17 <hi rend="italic">S.

Only in Act 5, when at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1820">1820</ref> the brothers start appearing together, does Compositor B, or the copy, consistently identify them.</p>

<p>Since all the compositors follow this pattern of designating the Dromios but not the Antipholuses, they are probably following copy, where keeping the Dromios straight is important because they are the cause of so much confusion from 1.2 on. Compositor C sets <hi rend="italic">Antip.</hi> at the bottom of H3<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, having set <hi rend="italic">An.</hi> six times at the top of the column; the speech, <quote>Plead you to me faire dame? I know you not,</quote> is the climax to Adriana’s attack on her <quote>husband</quote> for neglecting her, and the SP may well be authorial, though shortened to justify the line. Compositor C then sets H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, with three <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi>s and one <hi rend="italic">E. Ant.</hi> in column a, but then <hi rend="italic">Antiph.</hi> at the top of column b before settling into <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> (with one <hi rend="italic">Anti.</hi> and another <hi rend="italic">An.</hi> at the bottom of the column, set in a short line, followed by <hi rend="italic">An.</hi> in a condensed catchword). These anomalous spellings come near the beginning of Compositor C’s setting of Antipholus’s speeches, and he may have been trying to figure out what the best SP should be.</p>

<p>Next (Chart 1), we see that all three prefer <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> compared with B’s frequent <hi rend="italic">Anti.</hi> and prefer or tolerate the shorter <hi rend="italic">Adr.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Luc.</hi>, the forms that B much prefers. The first time Compositor C sets Luciana’s speeches (after recovery from calling her <quote><hi rend="italic">Iuliana</hi></quote> in H4<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>), he sets <hi rend="italic">Luci.</hi> (H3<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> and H2<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>); and the first time he sets Adriana’s speeches, he sets <hi rend="italic">Adri.</hi> (H3<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, 2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, except for one <hi rend="italic">Ad.</hi> in a full line), but on H2<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, the only other time he sets her speeches, he sets <hi rend="italic">Adr.</hi> five times and <hi rend="italic">Adri.</hi> another five, including a catchword. It is tempting to think that the long form is influenced by copy. Compositor D, however, strongly prefers <hi rend="italic">Luc.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Adr.</hi> from the beginning.</p>

<p>In Act 5, Egeon enters, called by a number of variations on Father. He is <hi rend="italic">Mar. Fat.</hi> (I1<hi rend="superscript">va</hi> in the order of setting); <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Siracuse</hi> (SD, I1<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>); <hi rend="italic">Fa.</hi> (4 [2f]), <hi rend="italic">Fath.</hi> (3), <hi rend="italic">Father.</hi> (in a verse line set as two prose lines), <hi rend="italic">Fat.</hi> (1), all on I2<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Fa.</hi> once again, in the next column. <hi rend="italic">Mar. Fat.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Siracuse</hi> look authorial, but the remaining forms are anybody’s guess.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0021">Compositor B has been studied thoroughly, including his setting of verse as prose by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1978a"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1984), who does not study <title level="m">Err.</title> because he deals with how compositors change printed copy in setting F, and how Compositors A and B demonstrate different lining habits. Compositor B’s tendency to set SDs flush right has been noticed, but no one has observed another punctuating habit, that of omitting periods in many SDs and, in <title level="m">Err.</title> but not often in the other plays he set, at the ends of sentences that fill up his type measure. In the comedies, only Compositor B regularly omits periods in SDs; Compositor D does it once much later (Q4<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi> 456), and Compositor A also once (Aa2<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi> 452). (In the histories, Compositor A fails to punctuate just seven times; in the tragedies, when Compositor E appears, he fails to punctuate about as often as B.) These full-set lines lack periods: <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1111">1111</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1388">1388</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1398">1398</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1562">1562</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1597">1597</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1851">1851</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1901">1901</ref>.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0009-a"/>
<p>We saw above that <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt1973"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1975"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref> were interested in <hi rend="italic">indented</hi> flow-overs as a way of distinguishing compositors. I am now looking at what happens when compositors do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> indent turned verse lines. A feature of <siglum>F1</siglum> <title level="m">Err.</title> is lines of verse set as prose, scattered between <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0347">347</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1914" targetEnd="#tln_1915">1914–15</ref> but clustering in the work of Compositor B (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1335">1335</ref> through <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1916">1916</ref>), as listed below. In most of the instances involving 10-syllable lines, one or two words are turned under at the left margin for lack of space in the first type line. To produce these flow-overs, all three compositors often set extra spaces between words and commas.</p>

<p>Likewise, variable spacing—compressed and expanded—is a standard way compositors meet the demands of fitting text into the space available. Expanded spacing is used to make space to fit in text that has been undercounted in casting off. The frequency with which Compositor B uses expanded spacing seems to have no bearing on this verse lined as prose, since he could have indented his flow-overs and achieved the same spatial effect. Compositor B expands normal spacing significantly more often than the others do, especially in <title level="m">Err.</title>, where he is setting from a different kind of copy from what he had before. Here are examples of his practice, contrasting normal spacing with extra spacing.

<quote rend="block"><sp><p>Free from these slanders, and this open shame. [normal spacing]</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Anti.</speaker><p>Din’d at home ? Thou Villaine,<space extent="1em"/>what<space extent="1em"/>sayest

or

<quote rend="block"><sp><speaker>Dro.</speaker><p>Perdie, your doores were lockt ,<space extent="1em"/>and you shut
<lb/>out. [extra] <nvsSeg type="marginalia"><ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1356" targetEnd="#tln_1357">1356–7</ref></nvsSeg></p></sp></quote>

There is not quite enough space to fit <hi rend="italic">thou?</hi> and <hi rend="italic">out.</hi> into <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1352">1352</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1356">1356</ref>, so Compositor B adds spaces to justify the line before going on.</p>

<p>Compositor B does not try hard to fit the verse line into the type line by abbreviation: but see <hi rend="italic">husbãd</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1608">1608</ref>), <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="superscript">t</hi> (a logotype, the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> above the cleft of the <hi rend="italic">y</hi>) (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1673">1673</ref>), and <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1909">1909</ref>), as well as the missing periods noted above. This list does not include SDs set flush with the right margin, which he punctuates with periods about half the time (8 of 15).</p>

<p>Compositor D abbreviates when he can:

<quote rend="block"><quote>If y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> skin were parchment, &amp; y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> blows you gaue were ink,</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0631">631</ref>, with two logotypes); <hi rend="italic">countermãds</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1146">1146</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Iudgmẽt</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1149">1149</ref>), <hi rend="italic">hel</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1149">1149</ref>).</quote></p>

<p>The single certain example from Compositor C’s work (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0442" targetEnd="#tln_0444">442–4</ref>) is slightly different; see the discussion below:

<quote rend="block"><sp><speaker>S.Dro.</speaker><p>Was there euer anie man thus<space extent="1em"/>beaten out of
<lb/>season,<space extent="1em"/>when in the why and the wherefore,<space extent="1em"/>is neither
<lb/>rime nor reason. Well sir,I thanke you.</p></sp></quote></p>

<p>In the Folio pages set before <title level="m">Err.</title>, I find two instances of these open-spacing practices, both in the work of Compositor B in <title level="m">MM</title>: at F6<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, 1251–2, in a passage of concealed verse lines 1249–61; and at G3<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, 2200–1. There are a few in the remainder of the comedies: K6<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, 2347–8, where Q <title level="m">Ado</title>, printer’s copy for F, has verse; M3<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, 2049–50, where Q <title level="m">LLL</title> has one verse line; M3<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>, 2112–13 and 2114–15, where Q <title level="m">LLL</title> has verse; P6<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, 2169–70; S6<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>, 1084–5; T3<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>, 1896–7; X1<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, 1500–1. Flow-overs of verse lines do occur, but they are either unspaced or indented, e.g., A1<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, 66–7, unspaced; E2<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, 1652–3, unspaced; E5<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, 2389–90, unspaced; F1<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, 83, spaced but indented; K4<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, 1808–9, verse as prose copied from Q <title level="m">Ado</title>; X2<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, 1719–20, unspaced.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0041-a"/>
<p>The combined effect of these mislineations is that the compositors misrepresent the verse lines of their copy. The flow-overs produced by spacing are important because of editorial uncertainty about whether to treat the lines as verse or prose. Now, however, editors are justified in counting these prose-set lines as verse. There is some danger in not attending to these flow-overs. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_eccm1980"><name type="app">Eccles</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">MM</title>, 1980) does not note or comment on the two occurrences listed above, so a reader of his text would not know that verse is intended, and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spem1990"><name type="app">Spevack</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">Ant.</title>, 1990) has the same failing at TLN <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0024" targetEnd="#tln_0025">24–5</ref>.</p>

<p>The following table lists the unindented flow-overs; the asterisk marks expanded spacing.</p>


<list xml:id="list_app_005">

<p><ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0442" targetEnd="#tln_0444">442–4</ref>* <quote>Was&hellip;reason</quote> These lines are on H2<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>, a forme in both corrected and uncorrected states (the correction is in line <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0430">430</ref>). The bottom five lines of the preceding column show signs of typographical squeezing, suggesting that the compositor had to fit more text into those lines than he had expected to, probably because, beginning at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0430">430</ref> and continuing to <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0504">504</ref> on the next page, the scene is in stichomythic prose (except for the disguised rhymed couplet above) that may have proved difficult to cast off accurately. The quoted lines comprise a rhymed doggerel couplet plus five additional words. His overriding the couplet, in the context of other evidence of his having trouble with space on this page, suggests that the mistake is his, not something he set faithfully from his copy. It is also possible, however, that that couplet might have been thoroughly disguised in the midst of the staccato prose, and the rhyme inaudible—invisible—to him.</p></item>

<head>The Printer’s Copy</head>

<p>Commentators generally describe the text as an unusually good one. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_knt2"><name type="app">Knight</name></ref> (ed. 1842, p. 125): <quote>This copy presents many typographical errors; and in a few passages the text is manifestly corrupt. The difficulties, however, are not very considerable; and the original copy is decidedly better, for the most part, than the modern innovations. Malone, in adhering to this text, was more distinctly opposed to Steevens than in other plays, in which he has, though evidently contrary to his own better opinion, adopted the suggestions of Steevens and others, who introduced what they considered amendments, but which amendments were founded upon an imperfect knowledge of the phraseology and metre of their author. The rejections by Malone of the changes of Steevens are here made with somewhat more of pertinacity, and perhaps of ill-temper, than was common with him.</quote> For an example of Malone’s <quote>ill-temper,</quote> see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0585-03">585</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Sprights</hi>).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard1a"><name type="app">Cuningham</name></ref> (ed. 1907, p. xi) believes <siglum>F</siglum> was printed from Sh.’s MS. He notes that <title level="m">Err.</title> has no names of the characters at the end as do three of the preceding plays, <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>, and <title level="m">MM</title>: <quote>We are left to conjecture the reason, which was probably sheer carelessness, if not too rapid work, on the part of the printers, and the want of any proper supervision; since there is ample room for the names on folio 100, the concluding page of the play.</quote> The lists of dramatis personae were probably provided by Ralph Crane.</p>

<p>Approval of the text is borne out by listing the number of unquestioned or probable mistakes committed by the three compositors. Compositor C produces dittography at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0020" targetEnd="#tln_0021">20–1</ref> (<quote>any&hellip;any</quote>), at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0154">154</ref> (<quote>helth&hellip;helth</quote>), and at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0407">407</ref> (<quote>did didst</quote>). He gets pronouns wrong at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0126">126</ref> (<quote>them</quote> for <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>), <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0474">474</ref> (<quote>them</quote> for probable <hi rend="italic">men</hi>), and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0750">750</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0752">752</ref> (<quote>your&hellip;your</quote> for <hi rend="italic">her&hellip;her</hi>). He garbles <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0383">383</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0385" targetEnd="#tln_0389">385–9</ref> so badly that no one can figure out how to emend. He sets <quote>vp</quote> for <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0105">105</ref>), <quote>backe</quote> for <hi rend="italic">barke</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0119">119</ref>), <quote>too</quote> for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0320">320</ref>), <quote>hundred</quote> for <hi rend="italic">thousand</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0338">338</ref>), <quote>trying</quote> for <hi rend="italic">tyring</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0492">492</ref>), <quote>ruinate</quote> for ?<hi rend="italic">ruinous</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0790">790</ref>), <quote>attaine</quote> for <hi rend="italic">attaint</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0802">802</ref>), <quote>not</quote> for <hi rend="italic">but</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0807">807</ref>), and <quote>do</quote> for <hi rend="italic">you do</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1243">1243</ref>). The dittographs and the garbling probably result from his characteristically attempting to memorize too much (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1977"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref>, 1977, p. 60).</p>

<p>Compositor D’s mistakes seem to be the result of misreading; his substitutions are orthographically similar to what he misreads, hence he is <quote>easier to emend</quote> than Compositor C (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj1977"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref>, p. 61). His <quote>a riuall</quote> for <hi rend="italic">arrival</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0166">166</ref>), <quote>cooke</quote> for <hi rend="italic">clock</hi>[<hi rend="italic">e</hi>] (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0231">231</ref>), <quote>adore</quote> for <hi rend="italic">a’ door</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0285">285</ref>), <quote>thus</quote> for <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0286">286</ref>), <quote>stranger</quote> for <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0569">569</ref>), <quote>free’d</quote> for <hi rend="italic">offer’d</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0581">581</ref>), <quote>a name</quote> for <hi rend="italic">an aim</hi> [= <quote>ame</quote>] (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0677">677</ref>), <quote>hope</quote> for <hi rend="italic">trow</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0693">693</ref>), <quote>bud</quote> for ?<hi rend="italic">bed</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0836">836</ref>), <quote>thee</quote> for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0836">836</ref>), <quote>when</quote> for <hi rend="italic">where</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0844">844</ref>), and <quote>Thus</quote> for <hi rend="italic">That</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1160">1160</ref>) look like careless work rather than difficulty with his copy. To these may be added <quote>God sake</quote> for ?<hi rend="italic">God’s sake</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0258">258</ref>), <quote>sister</quote> for <hi rend="italic">sister’s</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0833">833</ref>), and <quote>ships</quote> for <hi rend="italic">ship</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1218">1218</ref>), all of which involve D’s characteristic trouble with initial and final -<hi rend="italic">s</hi> (O’Connor, p. 67).</p>

<p>Compositor B sets <quote>is</quote> for ?<hi rend="italic">and</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0900">900</ref>), <quote>chalkle</quote> for <hi rend="italic">chalkie</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0917">917</ref>), <quote>depth</quote> for <hi rend="italic">death</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1590">1590</ref>). He makes a single pronoun mistake: <quote>their</quote> for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0999">999</ref>). <quote>Oh,</quote> for <hi rend="italic">Of</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1109">1109</ref>) rounds out the errors that most editors emend.</p>

<p>Other possible errors do not draw agreement that they are wrong: <quote>me by</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1042">1042</ref>), the first <quote>sir</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1076">1076</ref>), <quote>glanced it</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1535">1535</ref>), <quote>go</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1895">1895</ref>), and the second <quote>Natiuitie</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1896">1896</ref>) have all been defended; <quote>burthen are</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1892">1892</ref>) is a recognized problem, but whether it should read <hi rend="italic">burdens are</hi> or <hi rend="italic">burden ne’er</hi> is undecided. Like Compositor D, B sets <quote>God sake</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1498">1498</ref>), raising the possibility that both are authorial forms.</p>

<p>Some mistaken punctuation occurs and, as I have shown, quite a lot of verse is set as prose. But the small number of errors, and especially of those that defy satisfactory emendation, confirms the repeated opinion that <title level="m">Err.</title> is a good text. <siglum>F2</siglum> emends 13 of the substantive mistakes in <siglum>F1</siglum> that most subsequent eds. adopt, and <siglum>F3</siglum> emends 3 more. Of course, there may be hidden, unrecoverable errors the compositors made but that make such good sense that they are undetected. The Commentary discusses all the certain and possible errors.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0024">Until very recently, critics agreed that the play was set from Sh.’s autograph manuscript (<quote>foul papers</quote>), perhaps lightly annotated in the playhouse for performance purposes. But <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1988"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1988, p. 244) advises caution: <quote>What then is the nature of the manuscript underlying the Folio text of <title level="m">Errors</title>? This question, it seems to me, must go without an answer.</quote> His doubts are too recent to have influenced eds.</p>

<p>Evidence that Sh.’s own hand lies close to the printer’s copy, if in fact that copy was not his manuscript, comes chiefly from the SDs and SPs. These have usually been characterized as too confusing to serve in a prompt-book; see, e.g., <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_evns"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref> (ed. 1974, p. 104), and, in German, <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_rosk1982"><name type="app">Tetzeli von Rosador</name></ref> (ed. 1982, pp. 11 f.). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1988"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1988, pp. 239–40) believes that the difficulties posed by the variations may be overstated. The following are the inconsistencies usually offered as evidence:</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Merchant of Siracusa</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0002">2</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Marchant.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0004">4</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Mer.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0030">30</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Merch.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0101">101</ref>) for Egeon in <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0001">1</ref>.<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0001">1</ref>.; <hi rend="italic">Mar. Fat.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1671">1671</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Fa.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1762">1762</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1778">1778</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1785">1785</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1801">1801</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1838">1838</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Fath.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1766">1766</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1771">1771</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1788">1788</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Father.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1775">1775</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Fat.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1783">1783</ref>) in 5.1; it must be granted that the various <hi rend="italic">Father</hi> SPs would not confuse anyone, and some may be compositorial.</p>

<p>There is a failure to distinguish two Ephesian merchants, the first at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0162">162</ref>, the second at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0981">981</ref>.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Enter Antipholis Erotes.</hi>&hellip;(<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0162">162</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Enter Antipholis Errotis</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0394">394</ref>). <hi rend="italic">Erotes</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Errotis</hi> are probably errors for <hi rend="italic">Erraticus</hi> (wanderer). These are slightly misleading to a reader because they identify <hi rend="italic">S.</hi> Antipholus, not his Ephesian brother. <hi rend="italic">Antipholis</hi> is spelled this way by Compositor C only in a SD (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0394">394</ref>), but he spells <hi rend="italic">Antipholus</hi> at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0505">505</ref> in dialogue. All but one—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0273">273</ref>—of the variations (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0162">162</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0273">273</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0394">394</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0409">409</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0786">786</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0788">788</ref>) involving proper names occur in the work of Compositor C, as does the most serious garbling in the dialogue (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0383" targetEnd="#tln_0389">383–9</ref>), so it is tempting to suppose that C had trouble reading his copy. But the -<hi rend="italic">is</hi> spellings must have been in the printer’s copy, because both Compositors C and D had correctly set <hi rend="italic">Antipholus</hi> in H3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>–H4 and H3 when they started setting the play, before the -<hi rend="italic">is</hi> spellings on H2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, H2, and H1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Enter&hellip;Antipholis Sereptus</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0273" targetEnd="#tln_0274">273–4</ref>). <hi rend="italic">Sereptus</hi> is probably an error for <hi rend="italic">Surreptus</hi> (snatched away). This is misleading for <hi rend="italic">E.</hi> Antipholus. It is amusing that the garbled Latin should just reverse the initial letters of the twins’ designators, though of course only readers (including compositors) would have to deal with the problem, as in the next example.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">E. Ant.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0409">409</ref>), rather than <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi>, appears just once in 2.2. This is erroneous for S. Antipholus. Compositor C probably was influenced by <hi rend="italic">Errotis</hi> as he noticed that <hi rend="italic">S. Dro</hi> was being distinguished in the SPs.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Enter Luce</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0679">679</ref>), Compositor D. She becomes <hi rend="italic">Nell</hi> in dialogue (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0900">900</ref>, Compositor B) for the pun on her being <quote>an Ell and three quarters</quote> in girth (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0901">901</ref>).</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Enter Iuliana.</hi>&hellip;(<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0786">786</ref>), SP <hi rend="italic">Iulia</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0787">787</ref>) H4<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, Compositor C; Compositor D correctly sets <hi rend="italic">Luc.</hi> in column b. Eds. have thought that the mistake lay in the manuscript, possibly reflecting Sh.’s uncertainty about what to call her, but this is the first page of the typesetting of <title level="m">Err.</title>, and it is most likely that Compositor C misread his copy, whereas Compositor D got it right.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Enter Angelo with the Chaine</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0955">955</ref>), with SP <hi rend="italic">Ang.</hi> to his exit at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0972">972</ref>, near the end of Act 3 (H4<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi>, Compositor B). Beginning at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0981">981</ref> (4.1) he is <hi rend="italic">Goldsmith.</hi> His reappearance on stage after only eight lines following his exit is unusually soon in Sh.; I think it argues for a clearly marked pause in the action beyond what a scene ending might indicate. At the beginning of Act 3 (H3<hi rend="superscript">va</hi>, Compositor D), he enters as <hi rend="italic">Angelo the Goldsmith</hi>, so the text is clear about his name and trade (that is, both are written down; the dialogue tells the audience the same facts). At the beginning of Act 4, Sh.—I suppose—chooses the term (<hi rend="italic">Goldsmith</hi>) that he likes at the moment. Perhaps the shift from name to trade indicates a hiatus in the composition of the play?</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Curtizan</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1227">1227</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Courtizan</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1321">1321</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1426">1426</ref>) and <hi rend="italic">Courtezan</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1497">1497</ref>) are given in SDs, but in SPs <hi rend="italic">Curt.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1328">1328</ref>) and <hi rend="italic">Cur.</hi> (e.g., <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1334">1334</ref>). These are minor discrepancies that cause no trouble. The conclusion to be drawn is that printer’s copy was Sh.’s manuscript.</p>

<p>Stage directions for entrances and exits are clear and reasonably complete. Some are indefinite or permissive directions, usually understood as indicating the author’s own hand in the manuscript; others are descriptive directions, usually understood as the author’s visualization of the action or else additions to the manuscript of performance activity. See <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1988"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1988) for an analysis of the SDs that makes him skeptical that they can be used to identify with complete certainty just who is responsible for the wording; he quotes some of the extant dramatic MSS classified by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1931"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> in 1931 (<hi rend="italic">Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses</hi> vol. 2) under the anachronistic term <hi rend="italic">promptbooks</hi> to show that there are unclear SDs in them, sometimes because theatrical personnel left authorial SDs unchanged.</p>

<p>The indefinite directions include <hi rend="italic">Enter the Duke of Ephesus, with the Merchant of Siracusa, Iaylor, and other attendants</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0002" targetEnd="#tln_0003">2–3</ref>), where the last two words leave the casting up to the resources of the acting company. Likewise <hi rend="italic">Enter Adriana</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Luciana, Courtezan, &amp; others</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1497">1497</ref>), <hi rend="italic">Enter&hellip;&amp; other Officers</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1599" targetEnd="#tln_1601">1599–1601</ref>). Last, <hi rend="italic">Exit one to the Abbesse</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1761">1761</ref>), where from a full stage—13 speaking characters plus <quote>others</quote>—there are plenty of people to draw from, but Sh. did not specify which <quote>one.</quote> Akin to these is <hi rend="italic">Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1394">1394</ref>), where the <hi rend="italic">three or foure</hi> is permissive.</p>

<p>Descriptive directions deal with props, stage action, and elaborations of characters’ names (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Angelo the Goldsmith, and Balthaser the Merchant</hi>—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0617" targetEnd="#tln_0618">617–18</ref>), matters that strictly speaking affect the audience rather than the actor, who is supposed to know who he is, what to bring on stage, and what to do once there. One cannot be sure whether such directions derive from the author or are records of useful performance experience.</p>

<p>Those involving props are <hi rend="italic">Enter Angelo with the Chaine</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0955">955</ref>), followed three lines later by, <quote>loe here’s the chaine,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">Enter Dromio Eph. with a ropes end</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1288">1288</ref>), followed by language making it clear what he bears. Both props have thematic importance, hence Sh. might be emphasizing them; yet the bag of coins S. Antipholus brings to Ephesus is likewise thematically important but is never denoted by a SD, as it might be at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0170" targetEnd="#tln_0171">170–1</ref> (<quote>There is your monie that I had to keepe. <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> Goe beare it to the Centaure, where we host</quote>). In 4.2, where S. Dromio goes to fetch a purse of money to pay <quote>his master’s debt,</quote> <hi rend="italic">Enter Luciana</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1178">1178</ref>) might easily be completed, <hi rend="italic">with the purse</hi>. Such lack of systematic identification of major, thematic props seems most likely to point to the author.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0018-a"/>
<p>As the play draws to its climax, stage action becomes hectic and the SDs grow more elaborate, beginning with <hi rend="italic">Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him: Hee striues</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1394" targetEnd="#tln_1395">1394–5</ref>). <hi rend="italic">Enter Antipholus Siracusia with his Rapier drawne</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and Dromio Sirac.</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1440" targetEnd="#tln_1441">1440–1</ref>) marks the climax of S. Antipholus’s belief that he is besieged by malign forces he is determined to flee from. He and Dromio had exited at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1263">1263</ref> after the Courtesan approached him; in the meantime his brother had been bound and removed to a madhouse, so the armed entrance is all the more alarming to the characters who suppose the madmen are loose. The SD seems to say that only Antipholus is armed, but the dialogue, with its plurals, makes it clear that Dromio has a rapier as well.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0040-a"/>
<p>Their entrance precipitates the most perplexing direction in the play, <hi rend="italic">Runne all out</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1445">1445</ref>) and (two lines later) <hi rend="italic">Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1447">1447</ref>). Such literary descriptions, common in play texts, are often regarded as evidence of the author’s own hand, but <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:306 f.) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1954"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1942; 1954, p. 140, and 1955, p. 201) believe that Sh.’s foul papers were lightly annotated by a prompter or book-keeper, Greg pointing especially to <hi rend="italic">Exeunt omnes</hi> as a book-keeper’s mistaken addition. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xiii ff.) argues against them: <quote part="I">It is reasonable to suppose that a stage-direction was somehow duplicated at this point, but the ready and easy way of accounting for what happened, by invoking a prompter, is not very convincing. At first sight it looks plausible enough to argue, as W. W. Greg does, that <quote>Exeunt omnes</quote> was added by a prompter or book-keeper on the left of the manuscript page, so <quote>duplicating the author’s original direction on the right,</quote> and that the compositor [<hi rend="italic">xiv</hi>] fitted them together in the printed text. He went on to say <quote>it is possible that the similar <quote>Exeunt omnes</quote> at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1898">1898</ref>] was also an addition by the book-keeper.&hellip;</quote></quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">However, Greg does not seem to have realized that the direction at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1898">1898</ref>] takes a common Shakespearian form, and is not at all analogous to the duplication at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1445">1445</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1447">1447</ref>]; it is in fact paralleled by the direction at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1426">1426</ref>], <quote>Exeunt. Manet Offic. Adri. Luci. Courtizan.</quote> As for the duplication at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1665">1665</ref>], this may well be a compositor’s careless expansion of what was in the manuscript—perhaps <quote>Enter E. Antipholus and E. Dromio.</quote> In other directions of this kind both characters are usually identified as of Syracuse or Ephesus, as at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1440" targetEnd="#tln_1441">1440–1</ref>], <quote>Enter Antipholus of Siracusia with his Rapier drawne, and Dromio Sirac.,</quote> or [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1811" targetEnd="#tln_1812">1811–12</ref>], <quote>Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus Siracusa, and Dromio Sir.,</quote> and it may be conjectured that here the identification of Antipholus has been transferred to the end of the direction. The phrase <quote>a School-master, call’d Pinch,</quote>&hellip;is probably authorial, and Greg could not see why Chambers wanted to invoke a prompter to explain it; but the reason is, I think, clear enough, and it is the same reason that caused Greg to detect the intervention of a prompter at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1665">1665</ref>] and [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1898">1898</ref>]. Both scholars wished to account for the split direction and duplication at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1445">1445</ref>]; this could be plausibly explained by supposing that a prompter made an addition to the manuscript at this point; and this explanation would appear more convincing if the prompter’s hand could be found elsewhere.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">It was natural that, having discovered signs of the prompter, they should find him useful in elucidating other difficulties. However, there is no need to invoke him elsewhere than at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1445">1445</ref>], and this passage deserves further scrutiny, to see whether an alternative explanation may not be just as satisfactory. The fact that the passage in F is split between the foot of one column and the top of another needs to be taken into account.</quote> He suggests that Sh. wrote a single direction in the right margin of his manuscript (p. xv), <quote>but divided it because of its length into two lines, <quote>Runne all out / as fast as may be, frighted,</quote> then, in the accident of printing, and of the division between columns, the direction was split into two and attached to different lines. If so, then <quote>Exeunt omnes</quote> could be the compositor’s addition to make sense of <quote>as fast as may be, frighted.</quote></quote></p>

<p>What <quote>accident of printing</quote> he does not say, but perhaps he was thinking of how a compositor might discover, as he transferred his block of composed type from the setting stick to the forme, that he had set too much for column a, and had to improvise to start column b, thus separating what had been a comprehensible SD. But again, this procedure hardly accounts for the fact that <hi rend="italic">Runne all out</hi> is set in the empty space left in column a to match the space in column b used for catchwords and signatures. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> is misleading when he says <quote>the passage in F is split at the foot of one column and the top of another,</quote> since <quote>foot</quote> means the last line of type normally used in a type page for text. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1988"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1988, p. 244) thinks the placement of <hi rend="italic">Runne all out</hi> in the direction line is unique in F and continues: <quote part="I">It would appear that Compositor B was ready to take extraordinary measures to avoid setting a marginal stage direction at the top of a column. For this reason, he would not have completed the direction begun at the bottom of column H6va with the top line of column H6vb. That is, if Foakes (and Greg) are right in believing that Shakespeare wrote only a single stage direction, it is probable that Compositor B would have split it in two to avoid the typographical blemish of a marginal stage direction beginning a column.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">My only reservation about Foakes’s account is the possibility that Shakespeare himself could have written both stage directions as they now stand. <quote><hi rend="italic">Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted</hi></quote> closely resembles the following stage directions in the First Folio text of <title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title>: <quote><hi rend="italic">Exit Biondello, Tranio and Pedant as fast as may be</hi></quote> (TLN <rs type="sh" key="Shr.">2490</rs>), [likewise] thought to have been printed from [annotated foul papers].</quote> In support of Sh.’s having written the SD is Compositor B’s preference for <hi rend="italic">run</hi>, and the judgment that he sets <hi rend="italic">runne</hi> under influence of his copy (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_reis1976"><name type="app">Reid</name></ref>, 1976, p. 131).</p>

<p>It may be noted that there is enough space in <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1447">1447</ref> to fit in <hi rend="italic">Runne all out</hi> with the rest of the direction. The line would then run the length of the type line, and look like the SD at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1497">1497</ref> at the bottom of the same column, <hi rend="italic">They draw. Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtezan, &amp; others</hi>. That setting would be a simpler or, if not simpler, a more conventional one than the extraordinary measure Compositor B took.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> concludes (p. xvi): <quote>It is unnecessary to introduce a prompter&hellip;to account for the peculiarities of this text; they may all be explained in terms of an author inattentive to petty details, a printer who added act-divisions, and compositors who solved an occasional puzzle as best they could.</quote> He does not explain on what principles a printer would provide act divisions, a very doubtful suggestion.</p>

<p>Editors have been powerfully influenced by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1954"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1942; 1954) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1955"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1955), e.g., <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pel1"><name type="app">Jorgensen</name></ref> (ed. 1964, p. 26), <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_kitg1966"><name type="app">Kittredge</name> &amp; <name type="app">Ribner</name></ref> (ed. 1966, p. xi), <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pen2"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (ed. 1972, p. 183), <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ban2"><name type="app">Bevington</name></ref> (ed. 1988, p. 76).</p>

<p>Continuing with the descriptive SDs: <hi rend="italic">They draw</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1497">1497</ref>), part of the action continuing from 4.4 into the beginning of Act 5, falls into the same category of literary authorial descriptions. Perhaps slightly different are <hi rend="italic">Cry within</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1657">1657</ref>) and <hi rend="italic">All gather to see them</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1815">1815</ref>). The first prompts <quote>Harke, harke, I heare him Mistris: flie, be gone</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1658">1658</ref>) and might indeed literally be a prompt inserted into the MS by Sh. or another, though it comes without warning to anyone holding the book, hence would be of little value as a backstage aid. The other direction, <hi rend="italic">All gather to see them</hi>, comes when the Abbess brings S. Antipholus and S. Dromio out of the abbey to join their twins onstage for the first time. Such a clustering was inevitable, but the SD might mark a decision about how to block the climactic moment. <hi rend="italic">Enter the Duke of Ephesus, and the Merchant of Siracuse bare head, with the Headsman, &amp; other Officers</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1599" targetEnd="#tln_1601">1599–1601</ref>), has, in <hi rend="italic">bare head</hi>, a phrase so thoroughly integrated into the large entrance as to make it very doubtful that it is not authorial; besides, the direction is indefinite. <hi rend="italic">Beats Dro.</hi> occurs at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0418">418</ref>, where it is not necessary (<quote>take thou that, &amp; that</quote>) and at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1327">1327</ref>, but not at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1299">1299</ref>, where it might be most needed (<quote>And to that end sir, I will welcome you</quote>). (Pope adds it.) E. Antipholus uses the newly provided rope at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1327">1327</ref> (<quote>Wilt thou still talke?</quote>). Such randomness seems authorial, though not irrefutably so.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0014">Three directions apparently point to special staging effects, the use of three locales: the bay; the abbey; and the Porcupine, the Courtesan’s house. <hi rend="italic">Enter Dromio Sira. from the Bay</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1073">1073</ref>) is oddly literary rather than theater-based, for of course it means <quote>from the stage door that conventionally in this play is used for characters coming into Ephesus from the water-front.</quote> Through that door, we may guess, enter S. Antipholus, S. Dromio, and the Merchant at the beginning of 1.2. Through it S. Dromio may depart when he is sent to find out if any vessel is available for escaping from Ephesus (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0937" targetEnd="#tln_0945">937–45</ref>). If the inn called the Centaur is thought of as a seaside inn, Dromio goes through that door at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0181">181</ref>, and his master and he use it at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1461">1461</ref>. <hi rend="italic">Enter Antipholus Ephes. Dromio from the Courtizans</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0995">995</ref>), and <hi rend="italic">Exeunt to the Priorie</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1503">1503</ref>) are likewise literary, but they may mean that these locales were marked with signs. It is hard to imagine who but Sh. wrote those directions.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1473">1473</ref>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:307) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1955"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1955, p. 201) argue that <hi rend="italic">againe</hi> means that the action is continuous from Act 4 to Act 5, hence that the act division is nonauthorial. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg1993"><name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (1993, p. 45 n.), arguing that F is printed from Sh.’s foul papers, thinks that the word <quote>indicates continuous writing rather than continuous performance</quote> and that the act divisions might well be authorial if the play were written specifically for Gray’s Inn.</p>

<p>Finally, <hi rend="italic">Enter Ladie Abbesse</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1504">1504</ref>) withholds the identity of Æmilia even from the first readers of the manuscript (and the audience) and from all subsequent ones. Sh. may, of course, be thinking of how the actor is to be costumed; or he may be thinking, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mckr1935"><name type="app">McKerrow</name></ref> (1935, p. 465) argues, of her function as a peacemaker when she enters, especially as Sh. knows who she is. As with almost all the SDs, it is hard to imagine anyone but Sh. as being the author of this one.</p>

<p>Only one SD perhaps calls for an entrance at the wrong place, and that probably by no more than a single line. <hi rend="italic">Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him: Hee striues</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1394" targetEnd="#tln_1395">1394–5</ref>) might be better placed, as with <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref>, after Adriana’s <quote>Oh binde him, binde him, let him not come neere me</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1396" targetEnd="#tln_1397">1396–7</ref>).</p>

<p>Unmarked exits occur at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0361">361</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0615">615</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Exeunt</hi> perhaps omitted by Compositor D who had to use the last line in column b for the catchword <hi rend="italic">Actus</hi>), <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1279">1279</ref>, and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1581">1581</ref>, a very small number compared with most plays. Editors have expanded some directions, especially in 3.1, where the staging of the locked-out husband is so puzzling.</p>

<p><title level="m">Err.</title> was revived for presentation at court in 1604 (28 Dec., Innocents’ Day); one would think, although there is no evidence that it was or was not played in the intervening years (though <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_merf1598"><name type="app">Meres</name></ref> names it in 1598), that a version of the play that has as many apparent puzzles in it as this version has could not serve the playhouse well. Recent scholarship, however, has made it clear that just such manuscripts did serve as prompt-books. It seems best to believe that the printers got Sh.’s autograph manuscript or a decidedly unmediated copy of it to set the Folio text. See also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_werp1988"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref>’s warning, <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0024"/> above.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1922, pp. 65–83) develops an elaborate theory of printer’s copy involving a transcriber (Hand A) in the playhouse who wrote out the play as it was dictated to him from assembled players’ parts, i.e., the <quote>roles</quote> of paper containing only the lines a single character speaks. Wilson found evidence for such dictation-transcription in <quote>auditory misprints,</quote> mishearings in the course of transcribing, e.g., <quote>vnhappie a</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0204">204</ref>) for <hi rend="italic">unhappier</hi>, <quote>a name</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0677">677</ref>) for <hi rend="italic">an aim</hi>, <quote>burthen are</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1892">1892</ref>) for <hi rend="italic">burden ne’er</hi>, <quote>helpe</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0154">154</ref>) for <hi rend="italic">health</hi>, <quote>crime</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0536">536</ref>) for <hi rend="italic">grime</hi>. Another person (Hand B) added most of the SDs to that transcript, though he did not bother to read it but instead confidently put them in, relying on his memory of an earlier version of the play, the (nonextant) <title level="m">History of Error</title>, recorded once in 1577, which Sh. adapted by sporadic rewriting. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3b"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1962, p. 65) abandons most of his theory, but he is <quote>still inclined, however, to take the <quote>normal</quote> spelling and <quote>auditory misprints</quote> as evidence that the actual copy for [F] was not Shakespeare’s autograph MS but a transcript therefrom, such a transcript as might have been made for the Gray’s Inn performance or for the printers of [F].</quote> Misprints like these may be caused by compositors’ carrying words in their memories.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>’s reconstruction is elaborated by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref> (<title level="a">Evolution,</title> 1926), who posits an intermediate play between the 1577 <title level="m">History of Error</title> and <title level="m">Err.</title>; he thinks that the only plot element Sh. supplied beyond his sources was that involving Luciana.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0028"><ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (ed. 1928, p. 103) demolishes their theories, astutely objecting that <quote>the fundamental difficulty with the method of inconsistencies [listed above] is that it proves too much.</quote> That is, for every inconsistency there must be a fully developed solution that accounts for it alone. It is far simpler, he says, to make Sh. responsible for all the untidiness F exhibits, showing that Sh.’s known habits and the sources he relied on get rid of needlessly elaborate hypotheses.</p>

<p>The first apparent written notice of <title level="m">Err.</title> appears in <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>, an account of the Christmastide revels at Gray’s Inn in 1594. The Inn was a law school, one of several clustered together in London, that prepared young men for a career and offered them opportunities for recreation. One of these occasions took up the weeks between 20 Dec. 1594 and Shrovetide, the first three days in Feb. 1595; this extended party seems to have resulted from the long suspension of any revels, a hiatus caused by a bad siege of the plague from mid-1592 to spring 1594.</p>

<p>Though <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> was not printed until 1688, everyone since <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_male1780"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (1780, 1:103) first drew attention to it has granted the authenticity and contemporaneity of the account, which in somewhat sophomoric language tells of the revels engaged in by the law students during that holiday season, <quote>intermitted by the space of three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances,</quote> i.e., nonattendance (ed. Bland, 1968, p. 5). (For a full analysis and quoting of the relevant text, see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0003-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0003-b"/>.) The members of Gray’s Inn invited students and guests of the Inner Temple, another law school, to join their revelry on Holy Innocents’ Day, 28 Dec., but either because too many invitations were accepted or because of gate-crashing, Gray’s Inn hall became overcrowded and the planned entertainment was abandoned after the visiting Templarians left in a huff. As a substitution, <quote>a Comedy of Errors (like to <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> his <title level="m">Menechmus</title>) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, <title level="m">The Night of Errors</title></quote> (<title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>, ed. Bland, 1968, p. 32).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0031">The play is assumed to be Sh.’s. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_male1780"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> himself (above) thought that the reference in <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> was not to Sh.’s play, but <quote>was probably a translation from Plautus.</quote> <title level="m">Gesta</title>’s <quote>like to <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi></quote> probably influenced this judgment.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alep1929"><name type="app">Alexander</name></ref> (1929, pp. 196–7) makes an important argument based on the plague of mid–1592 to mid-1594: <quote>The central fact round which the fragmentary information of Shakespeare’s early career in London must be arranged is the Plague of 1592–[4].&hellip;It is a safe conjecture&hellip;that the plays they [the actors] took into the provinces in 1592 they brought back again without additions to their number: a company on tour would have no need or desire to commission new work.</quote> Hence the plays known to have been presented just after the return to London must predate the plague.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0036"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_uhlc1968"><name type="app">Uhlig</name></ref> (1968, pp. 450–5) sees a thematic notion repeated in <title level="m">Ven.</title>, <title level="m">R3</title>, and <title level="m">Err.</title> that opposes lust and love, the former leading to loss of identity, the latter to self-discovery and integration. The verbal similarities used to express this notion are so nearly identical that he thinks <title level="m">Err.</title> was probably composed soon after <title level="m">Ven.</title> (1592) and <title level="m">R3</title> (1592–3, Uhlig following <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1923"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>’s chronology)—<quote>after</quote> because, he says, only <title level="m">Err.</title> moves from how lust and self-hate confuse identity to the idea that love produces self-discovery.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xxii f.): <quote>The play has particular links also with two other plays. One is <title level="m">Love’s Labour’s Lost</title>, which is set at the court of the King of Navarre, and is generally thought to have been written when Henry of Navarre was engaged in civil war with the support of the English government and forces, that is, between 1591 and November 1593, when support for him was withdrawn on his becoming a Roman Catholic. This play, however, has its own dating problems, for it seems to refer to the Gray’s Inn Revels of Christmas 1594, in which, as in the play, there appears a mock-embassy of Russians, and also shows signs of a later revision. The play which has the closest links with <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is <title level="m">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</title>; there are many phrases, jests, and relatively unusual words, such as <quote>hapless,</quote> <quote>timeless,</quote> <quote>overshoes,</quote> <quote>minion,</quote> <quote>peevish,</quote> <quote>ruin&shy;[<hi rend="italic">xxiii</hi>]ous,</quote> and <quote>peasant</quote> (used of a servant) common to the two plays, and the <quote>vexing dialogue</quote> of the clowns, Launce and Speed, has connections with, and is similar in kind to, that of the Dromios, notably in such passages as the mock-inventory of the virtues of Launce’s mistress.&hellip;<title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title> has in common with these plays a use of doggerel couplets, and has connections with <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> both in the theme of the shrewish wife, Katherina, who is a type similar to Adriana, and in its indebtedness to George Gascoigne’s <title level="m">Supposes</title> (1566) for many details; Shakespeare seems to have known this play of errors and mistaken identities when he wrote his own play of errors.</quote> But dating <title level="m">TGV</title> and <title level="m">Shr.</title> is likewise difficult.</p>

<p><quote>These linkages tend to reinforce the supposition that <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> was written not long before or immediately after the long spell of plague which caused all acting to be prohibited in London throughout most of&hellip;1593.&hellip;It is not possible to be more conclusive than this.</quote></p>

<p>Edward Jacob, in his ed. of <title level="m">Arden of Faversham</title> (1770, p. vi), remarks on the similarity between the description of Doctor Pinch and that of one Jack Fitten, who does not appear in the play but is described.

Duke Solinus of Ephesus was engaged in a mercantile warfare. Likewise, Master Sheriff Offley, a merchant of London, was accustomed to act the prince [he played Prince Arthur in archery shows in the late 1580s], was at the time considered a London champion against Spain, and was prominently engaged in a mercantile warfare which had grown out of the struggle with that country. Aegeon was a hapless victim of the mercantile warfare, with whom Solinus sympathized, but whom he could not alter the law to save. As a merchant of souls (a frequent figure with priests generally), Hartley was the hapless victim of the warfare, both mercantile and religious, with Spain.

<p>An aspect of the verse, the doggerel (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0629" targetEnd="#tln_0744">629–744</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1136" targetEnd="#tln_1177">1136–77</ref>), confirms early commentators in dating <title level="m">Err.</title> among Sh.’s earliest plays. Doggerel (often spelled <hi rend="italic">doggrel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dogrel</hi>), a word of unknown origin but associated pejoratively by <title level="m">OED</title> with <quote>dog</quote> (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>.: <quote>An epithet applied to comic or burlesque verse; or to mean, trivial, or undignified verse</quote>), was the chief medium for comic verse in the drama before the 1580s, after which prose influenced by Lyly took over for a while. Most of the doggerel in <title level="m">Err.</title> occurs in 3.1 when E. Antipholus tries to enter his house for dinner with Angelo and Balthasar but is blocked by S. Dromio. Actually the doggerel begins at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0629">629</ref> and is so powerful that it draws all the speakers to it instead of being restricted, as one would expect, to the Dromios. It ends, after a transitional rhymed iambic couplet, with a return to blank verse at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0747">747</ref>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_blaw0001"><name type="app">Blackstone</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_male1780"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref>, 1780, 1:103): <quote>I suspect this and all other plays where much rhime is used, and especially in long hobbling verses, to have been among Shakspeare’s more early productions.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (ed. 1790, 2:203 n.) fleshes out the point: <quote>The long doggrel verses that Shakspeare has attributed&hellip;to the two Dromios, are written in that kind of metre which was usually attributed by the dramatick poets before his time, in their comick pieces, to some of their inferior characters; and this circumstance is one of many that authorize us to place [<title level="m">Err.</title> with <title level="m">LLL</title> and <title level="m">Shr.</title>] (where the same kind of versification is likewise found), among our author’s earliest productions; composed probably at a time when he was imperceptibly infected with the prevailing mode, and before he had completely learned <quote>to deviate boldly from the common track.</quote></quote> Examples in these early plays are <rs type="sh" key="LLL"><title level="m">LLL</title> 2.1.194 ff.

<p>The notion that Sh. could write such <quote>mean, trivial, or undignified verse</quote> brought opposition. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ritj0001"><name type="app">Ritson</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1793"><name type="app">Steevens</name></ref>, ed. 1793) objects to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_blaw0001"><name type="app">Blackstone</name></ref>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref>’s note above is not acknowledged, perhaps because of a falling out between Steevens and Malone, and because of Ritson’s animosity toward Malone): <quote>I have much doubt whether any of these <quote>long hobbling verses</quote> have the honour of proceeding from his pen; and, in fact, the superior elegance and harmony of his language is no less distinguishable in his earliest than his latest production. The truth is if any inference can be drawn from the most striking dissimilarity of stile, a tissue as different as silk and worsted, that this comedy though boasting the embellishments of our author’s genius, in additional words, lines, speeches, and scenes, was not originally his, but proceeded from some inferior playwright, who was capable of reading the <title level="m">Menæchmi</title> without the help of a translation, or, at least, did not make use of Warner’s.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0007">Critics who for various reasons think that Sh. adapted an earlier but not extant play (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0026"/>) point to the doggerel as fossil remnants of it, or perhaps as conscious imitations, e.g., <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_colj1831"><name type="app">Collier</name></ref> (1831, 3:62–3): <quote>The circumstance, that he borrowed certain parts from the old <title level="m">History of Error</title>, will explain all that the commentators have said regarding doggerel [<hi rend="italic">63</hi>] verses, and the apparent authorship of two different persons in the same play. The doggerel fourteen-syllabic verses given to the two Dromios are precisely such as were used in dramatic performances not long before the period when Shakespeare began to write for the stage.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_wh1"><name type="app">White</name></ref> (ed. 1857, 3:137): <quote>He deliberately imitated, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">populo ut placere[n]t</foreign>, the versification of the old play,</quote> alluding to Terence’s famous formulation in the prologue to <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi>, that the author thought his only business was to see that his <quote>plays pleased the people.</quote></p>

<p>Those who conclude that Sh. could never write such verse include <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_olie1908"><name type="app">Oliphant</name></ref> (1909, p. 349), <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1922, p. 77), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_robj1923"><name type="app">Robertson</name></ref> (1923, p. 127)—<quote>That any one should ever have seen a Shakespearean touch in any of it is a monition to us of the difficulty which faces every attempt to modify the temper of traditionism</quote> (he thinks Marlowe wrote the blank verse sections of <title level="m">Err.</title>)—and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref> (<title level="a">Evolution,</title> 1926), who tries to prove that <title level="m">Err.</title> was written by two earlier writers, <quote>A</quote> and <quote>B</quote> (Kyd) before Sh. brought it to its present shape. The hypothesis of a Shn. revision allows a later dating than would be possible if the whole play were Sh.’s apprentice work.</p>

<p>The fitful desire to see <title level="m">Err.</title> (and most of the earliest plays) as Sh.’s rewriting of earlier plays ends in the late 1920s, coincident with <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>’s (ed. 1928, pp. 106–7) devastating critique of <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref>: <quote>It is pointed out [uncited, but <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref>, <title level="a">Evolution,</title> 1926, p. 632] that the heart of [3.1] <quote>consists of doggerel couplets&hellip;which are identical in form with the typical metre of the mid-sixteenth century academic comedy, of which <title level="m">Ralph Roister-Doister</title> and <title level="m">Gammer Gurton’s Needle</title> are the sole surviving specimens [Wilson, ed. 1922, p. 77].</quote> I am at a loss to find any way in which these two plays may be said to be the sole survivors of the type.</quote> He refers to the plays quoted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (ed. 1790, 2:203–4). <quote>In [<hi rend="italic">107</hi>] more recent times, Mr. R. W. Bond [<title level="m">Early Plays from the Italian</title>, 1911, pp. lxxxiii ff.] has examined this doggerel verse to show that it was the prevalent early comic form, and was being displaced only in the decade between 1580–1590 by prose under the example of John Lyly.&hellip;It is thus clear that Malone’s is the natural inference: that since this doggerel form is a survival from the earlier period, Shakespeare’s plays in which it occurs presumably belong to his early work.&hellip;The considerable bulk of doggerel in Shakespeare’s early plays makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that Shakespeare must himself have written some of this type. But if he wrote some, then there is as yet no evidence nor inference to deprive him of any.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:308): <quote>It seems to me just as easy to suppose that here and in <title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title> and <title level="m">Love’s Labour’s Lost</title>, where there is also a substantial use of doggerel, Shakespeare was consciously experimenting with an archaistic form for comic effect.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">133</hi>] <quote part="M">Shakespeare’s writing after 1594 registers a strongly disproportionate recall of the Egeon role&hellip;relative to other characters in the play.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The structural match between the recollected language of W. S. and Shakespeare can be traced back to the earliest years of Shakespeare’s career. For instance, the Egeon role, which Shakespeare appears to have studied as early as 1594 and again in 1604–05 and 1612–13, supplies 11.9 percent of the rare words in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>. Of <title level="m">The Comedy</title>’s rare words that appear also in <title level="m">Henry VIII</title>, 22.0 percent are supplied by the Egeon role. In other words, Shaxicon locates roughly twice as many Egeon words in this cross sample as would be produced by a proportionate distribution by character. <title level="m">Henry VIII</title> is thus influenced by Shakespeare’s having learned the Egeon role. The role likewise influences other late texts. Of the rare words that appear both in <title level="m">The Comedy</title> and in Shakespeare’s portion of <title level="m">The Two Noble Kinsmen</title>, 39.0 percent are supplied by Egeon, more than triple Egeon’s share of the lexical pool.&hellip;In comparison, Egeon supplies just 11.4 percent of the rare words that appear in the cross sample of <title level="m">The Comedy</title> and Jonson’s <title level="m">Every Man in His Humor</title> and [<hi rend="italic">134</hi>] only 9.1 percent of the rare words that appear in the cross sample of <title level="m">The Comedy</title> and Fletcher’s presumed portions of <title level="m">The Two Noble Kinsmen</title> and <title level="m">Henry VIII</title>.

<head>Shakespeare’s Development</head>

<p>Critics who see a development in Sh.’s growth as a dramatist play-by-play, looking now at one aspect, now at another, usually grant that it is impossible to know the precise order of composition of the early comedies, but then construct one that supports their theories. Few attempt to give dates.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dowe1875"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> (1875, pp. 56–7) lists <title level="m">2, 3 H6</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>, <title level="m">LLL</title>, and <title level="m">Err.</title> as five experiments: <quote>The Comedy of Errors [is] a comedy of incident, of almost farcical adventure—the sole attempt of Shakspere at imitation of the comic drama of ancient Rome. In this [<hi rend="italic">57</hi>] play Shakspere gaily confronts improbabilities, and requires the spectator to accept them.&hellip;Let the incredible become a twofold incredibility, and it is none the worse. We may conclude that, while Shakspere was ready to try his hand upon a farcical subject, a single experiment satisfied him that this was not his province; for to such subjects he never returned.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dowe1882"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1877; 1882, pp. 37–9) lists impressionistic criteria for internal dating: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) style and diction: <quote>In the earliest plays the language is sometimes as it were a dress put upon the thought—a dress ornamented with superfluous care.&hellip;Under this head of style may be noticed Shakspere’s early conceits, puns, frequent classical allusions, occasional over-wrought rhetoric (especially in the historical plays), all of which gradually disappear or subside.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The growth of Shakspere’s taste and judgment.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">38</hi>] (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) In the structure of the play and grouping of characters there is, in some of the early plays, a tendency to formal symmetry, an artificial setting of character over against character, and group against group: Antipholus and Dromio against Antipholus and Dromio.&hellip;Afterwards the outline of the play is drawn with a freer because a firmer hand. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The characterisation changes. At first there are bright and clever sketches of character;&hellip;sometimes character is subordinate to incident (as in the <title level="m">Errors</title>&hellip;). By degrees the characterisation becomes profound and refined.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The entire reflective power deepens.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The imagination, which at first worked intermittently, leaving&hellip;spaces for the fancy to practise its slight devices in, becomes passionately energetic, of daring and all-comprehensive power.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) The sympathy with human passion and power of conceiving and dramatically rendering it in its most massive and most intense [<hi rend="italic">39</hi>] forms increases. (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>)&hellip;The humour of the dramatist, which was at first comparatively superficial—an enjoyment of amusing absurdity, with pleasure in the keen play of wit—becomes full of grave significance, and works in conjunction with his (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) Deepening pathos.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) Finally, in moral reach, in true justice, in charity, in self-control, in all that indicates fortitude of will, the writings of the mature Shakspere excel, in an extraordinary degree, those of his younger self.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dowe1882"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> knows that these matters cannot be <quote>weighed and measured</quote> but believes that the changes in Sh.’s verse admit <quote>of exact scientific estimations.</quote></p>

<p><quote>(1)&hellip;At first Shakspere has his breaks and pauses at the end of the line—the verse is <quote>end-stopt</quote>; gradually he more and more found pleasure in carrying on the sense from one line to another without a pause at the end of the line—the verse is <quote>run on,</quote> and the breaks and pauses occur with great frequency in some part of the line other than the end.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_latg1887"><name type="app">Latham</name></ref> (1892, pp. 399–401): <quote part="I">In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> the style is changed [from metaphors used to decorate rather than to define and illustrate thought as in <title level="m">LLL</title>], approaching more nearly to that of Shakspere’s later works than in any other of the first four comedies, especially the blank verse passages. In the opening the Duke uses metaphors to express his meaning with greater force [<hi rend="italic">400</hi>] than plain, straightforward speech could do; they give judicial weight.

<p><quote part="M">Ægeon’s long story is clearly and simply told, with a few metaphors to give it strength and vividness.

<p>[<hi rend="italic">401</hi>] <quote part="F">But when we come to the love scene between Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana, Act III. sc. ii., we get an artificial style, an evident strain after fine writing.

<p>[<hi rend="italic">140</hi>] <quote part="F">Indeed, so wise and so firm is the handling of the material in this adaptation [of Plautus] that one would almost be inclined to say a large part of its merit must date from the performance at Court in 1604, when Shakespeare had acquired his technique, were it not that the plays we are to consider next, <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title> and <title level="m">The Merchant of Venice</title>, give proof that shortly before their composition such work as this must have been possible for Shakespeare.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1927"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (1927, tables inserted between pp. 228 and 229) presents a chronology of the plays that, despite many repetitions and great elaboration, has not enlisted support. This chronology depends in part on his concept of how Sh. learned to manage the plotting of plays, discussed in the section on structure, <ptr targType="div" target="#div_tech_str_fiveact"/>. Baldwin’s chronology is as follows: <title level="m">LLL</title> in its first version, winter 1588; <title level="m">Love’s Labor’s Won</title>, an early version of <title level="m">AWW</title>, summer 1589; <title level="m">Err.</title>, winter 1589; <title level="m">TGV</title>, summer 1590. The chronicles and early tragedies were, he says, written after these four.</p>

<p>For several reasons—topical references and echoes of other works—<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1927"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> anchors <title level="m">Err.</title> before Christmas 1589, but he finds corroboration in the sequence he proposes. At the end of a very long book, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1947, p. 785) says that his true aim is to get the sequence of Sh.’s plays in order, not their absolute dates. But in fact he must make <title level="m">LLL</title> depend on an amalgamation of <title level="m">Endimion</title> and <title level="m">Gallathea</title>, plays he thinks Sh. saw in London in the season of 1587–8, because <title level="m">LLL</title> is his first play and so must predate <title level="m">Err.</title>, solidly fixed in 1589. That the two Lyly plays were printed in 1591 and 1592 makes it imperative that Sh. saw the plays earlier so that he could construct <title level="m">LLL.</title> (P. 623): <quote>The whole structure and character types and groupings&hellip;derived from <title level="m">Endimion</title> and Shakspere’s company, with some structural assistance from <title level="m">Gallathea</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rylg1928"><name type="app">Rylands</name></ref> (1928, pp. 140–1, 182): on Sh.’s early verse style, especially the anaphora (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0508" targetEnd="#tln_0513">508–13</ref>), which is <quote>the versification of poetry which is to be read, not spoken. It is the versification of Spenser, of <title level="m">Venus and Adonis</title> and <title level="m">Lucrece</title>, and it was some time before Shakespeare grew out of it. For one thing, it jingles prettily, for another, it helps to increase the speed. The actor can take the lines at a run.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">141</hi>] This might best be called <hi rend="italic">stanza movement</hi>&hellip;. [<hi rend="italic">182</hi>] Young poets, especially when they are writing to order and against time, use adjectives to fill up gaps. Shakespeare is no exception.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lanc1931"><name type="app">Langworthy</name></ref> (1931, p. 748), studying the diminishing correspondence of grammatical sense units (independent clauses, nonrestrictive clauses, etc.) with verse lines as Sh.’s career unfolded, places <title level="m">Err.</title> fifth, after <title level="m">1H6</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>, <title level="m">Shr</title>, and <title level="m">3H6</title>, before <title level="m">R3</title> and <title level="m">2H6.</title> He uses the Oxford (1925–7) text, which diminishes the value of his work because the ed. makes decisions about ambiguous syntax.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_elto1936"><name type="app">Elton</name></ref> (1936, p. 81), impressionistically surveying Sh.’s style, says of 1788–99: <quote>[Egeon’s] outcry might be too piercing for so light a play if we did not know that presently all will be well. The style—of the kind that comes to sustained perfection in the <title level="m">Dream</title>—is of the purest; and the verse, though still, and for long afterwards, moving within the bounds of the self-enclosed line, still runs over freely, the whole period being spoken almost in a breath.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chah1931"><name type="app">Charlton</name></ref> (1931; 1938, pp. 44 ff.) argues for the sequence <title level="m">LLL</title>, <title level="m">Err.</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>, <title level="m">Shr.</title> as he observes Sh. trying to harmonize the elements of romance and comedy, the one requiring men, especially, to behave in conventionally loverly ways that the theater finds absurd; romance tends toward sprawling plots, comedy requires considerable shaping. Hence he speaks of Sh.’s <quote>recoil</quote> from the (p. 47) <quote>formlessness and the spinelessness of the thing [<title level="m">LLL</title>] as a play</quote> to <quote>a discipline which, however uncongenial to the spirit, was a salutary apprenticeship to the mechanics of play-building.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clew1951"><name type="app">Clemen</name></ref> (1951, p. 219): <quote>This [early] style possessed its own merits and found expression, not only in diction and imagery, but in all other elements of dramatic art as well. Thus the artificial and formal quality of the imagery has its equivalent in the artificial and symmetrical grouping of the characters (e.g. in the <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title>). And the imagery’s tendency to typify and conventionalize rather than to individualize, to express commonplace truisms instead of unique experiences also corresponds to the whole manner and atmosphere of these early plays.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_half1954"><name type="app">Halliday</name></ref> (1954, pp. 71–2): <quote>The earliest example of [the] extension of the harmony from the line to the passage as a whole is in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, III.ii, where Antipholus of Syracuse makes love to the bewildered Luciana. His speech is in alternate rhyme, and the assonance is emphasized by fixing it on trochaic words that immediately precede or succeed the middle of the line:

<quote rend="block">Than our earth’s wonder; more than earth divine&hellip;[<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0819">819</ref>]
<lb/>To make it wander in an unknown field. [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0825">825</ref>]</quote>

[<hi rend="italic">72</hi>] It is all very self-conscious and unashamedly undramatic—Shakespeare has forgotten the play in the excitement of the poetry—but it is a development of profound significance.</quote> As so often, <quote>development</quote> depends on the chronology used by the critic.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1957, 1: 203): <quote>Since it [<title level="m">TGV</title>] replaces the dry hardness of <title level="m">A Comedy of Errors</title> [sic] and <title level="m">The Shrew</title> with some of the warmth and eloquence, the surplusage of word-play, found in <title level="m">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</title> and <title level="m">Love’s Labour’s Lost</title>, the play probably belongs to the same group, though it may be earlier than these, for it treats its romantic theme with a somewhat jejune absence of self-criticism hardly possible after their delighted mockery of love.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_trad1960"><name type="app">Traversi</name></ref> (1960, pp. 9–10, 13): <quote part="I">Since the working out of a complex pattern to its formal conclusion is an essential part of Shakespeare’s mature comic conception, we should not underestimate the importance of this exercise in plot-making to his developing art.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Scarcely less important is the skilful use of different forms of verse, and where necessary of a contrasted prose, to point the contrasts which operate within the carefully contrived unity of the plot. The prose given to the servants, generally to convey a comic comment upon the way in which their [<hi rend="italic">10</hi>] masters are behaving, stands out effectively against the stiffness of much of the surrounding verse. It can rise on occasion to a notable vivacity, as when Dromio of Syracuse describes for his master’s benefit <quote>the sargent of the band,</quote> the police officer coming to make his arrest: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1206" targetEnd="#tln_1211">1206–11</ref>]. The comparisons are indeed far-fetched in their variety, pressed too deliberately into use; but the vigour of the sequence, the firm grounding in situations seen and familiar, is of a kind that Shakespeare will develop to superb effect in his later work. Taken together with the lively use of the hitherto crude long verse line in a close chain of rhyming repartee (such as we find&hellip;in Act III scene i) and the solid construction of the blank verse whenever the play’s more serious moments require it, we must be struck with a facility, a fluent command of familiar modes of expression, that causes the play to stand out from its classical and contemporary models.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1963"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1963, pp. 163 ff.) studies character manipulation, finding that the ending of <title level="m">TGV</title> is much more primitive dramaturgically than those of <title level="m">Err.</title> or <title level="m">Shr.</title> In <title level="m">TGV</title> Sh. is <quote>limited almost exclusively to three devices: soliloquy, duologue, and the aside as comment,</quote> and when Sh. steps outside these limits he strands a third or fourth person who must look on, unaccounted for, as a pair speak, as notoriously in the final scene where (p. 165) <quote part="I">Sylvia says nothing at all while she is first donated by Valentine to Proteus, then rejected by him in favour of Julia, then claimed by Thurio, only in his next breath to be renounced by him, and finally handed back to Valentine by her father.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">&hellip;I find it difficult to [<hi rend="italic">166</hi>] imagine how a dramatist with a technique of character-manipulation as limited as this play reveals, not only in scenes, such as the last, where he had to wrestle with thematic complexities, but also in straightforward scenes of exposition, could, unaided, have plotted, for instance, the last scenes of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and <title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title> and much of <title level="m">Richard III</title>: plays often thought of as earlier than <title level="m">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</title>.</quote></p>

<p>On <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> above (p. 166): <quote>It seems to me equally possible that a young writer should begin with <quote>warmth and eloquence</quote> and only then, discovering in himself technical deficiencies, restrain these qualities at the risk of <quote>dry hardness</quote> in order to acquire greater formal discipline.</quote></p>

<p>His argument helps to persuade <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam4"><name type="app">Dorsch</name></ref> (ed. 1988, p. 6) that <title level="m">Err.</title> was written between Apr. 1591 and June 1592, after <title level="m">TGV</title> and <title level="m">Shr.</title></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_phip1966"><name type="app">Phialas</name></ref> (1966, p. 24), wishing to read the plays as nearly as possible in the order of their composition, objects to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chah1931"><name type="app">Charlton</name></ref>’s <quote>recoil</quote>: <quote>Shakespeare need not have been such an incorrigible recoiler. Instead, he may well have proceeded by writing the two early farces which, besides their own close relationship, are heavily indebted to Plautine theme and tone; and it is equally likely that <title level="m">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</title> initiates in earnest the entrance of romance into Shakespearean comedy, henceforth to become its chief theme for which the dramatist is to fashion his own special structure.</quote></p>

<p>Earlier, in his introductory chapter on <title level="m">Err.</title>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_phip1966"><name type="app">Phialas</name></ref> notes the additions of the shipwreck story and of Luciana as a romantic interest (p. 4): <quote>Shakespeare gave the whole a slightly new coloring by complicating its structure and by adding two new themes to the extravagant realism of the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>. One of these is the framing story of Egeon and Emilia, the accidentally separated parents of the lost twin brothers, which makes possible the general family reunion at the conclusion of the play.&hellip;The other addition&hellip;is the creation of Luciana and the episode of her wooing by Antipholus of Syracuse in [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0787" targetEnd="#tln_0860">787–860</ref>]. In view of Shakespeare’s later comedies this is a far more significant addition since love and wooing became the chief concern of those plays. In introducing these two themes Shakespeare attempted for the first time what he was to do far more adroitly later in play after play, that is, to present in meaningful comic relationship elements of romance and realism.</quote></p>

<p>He recognizes that the date of composition is not certain, but says that he is more interested in the sequence in which the early plays were written than in absolute dates.</p>

<p>(P. 6) <quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> shares with <title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title> a boisterous farcical action as well as the theme of the shrewish wife, a theme the latter play treats far more extensively. Furthermore, while <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> deals with love and wooing in a single episode, <title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title> devotes its entire action to the wooing of the two sisters&hellip;although of course the wooing of the latter is of a special kind. In the third play, <title level="m">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</title>, Shakespeare gives further prominence not only to wooing but also to romantic love which henceforth becomes the chief subject of his romantic comedy. This relative emphasis on wooing and romantic love in the three plays indicates strongly that <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> was almost certainly Shakespeare’s earliest comedy.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chal1970"><name type="app">Champion</name></ref> (1970, pp. 5 ff.) traces the development of Sh.’s characters in terms of increasing <quote part="I">credible growth through their interaction upon one another.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">9</hi>] <quote part="F">Shakespeare, then, whose development as a comic playwright is consistently in the direction of complexity or depth of characterization, deals with each of these levels of characterization. His earliest works, like those of his contemporaries, are essentially situation comedies: the humor arises from action rather than character. There is no significant development of the main characters; instead, they are manipulated into situations which are humorous as a result&hellip;of mistaken identity or slapstick confusion. Thus, the characters are revealed only in terms of what they do, outer action.

The fluent verse of <title level="m">Errors</title> suggests that like the other early comedies it was written after Shakespeare had already served his apprenticeship as a dramatic poet in the Henry VI plays.&hellip;At its best the poetry of <title level="m">Errors</title> has a colloquial ease and raciness that is not achieved in the history plays until the Bastard enters in <title level="m">King John</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_colh1993"><name type="app">Cole</name></ref> (1993, p. 241) thinks Sh. had read Laurence Twine’s <title level="m">The Patterne of Painefull Aduentures</title> (revised <title level="m">STC</title> 709.5, dated 1594; entered in S.R. 7 Jul. 1576), a version of <title level="a">Apollonius of Tyre,</title> and <title level="m">Mother Bombie</title> (entered in S.R. 18 June 1594) and was then asked in the summer or fall to produce something for the Gray’s Inn revels. He prefers the order <title level="m">TGV</title>, <title level="m">LLL</title>, <title level="m">Err.</title> Those revels were not settled on until Dec. 1594; see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0031"/>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1994"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1994, p. 57): <quote>Although much of it is written in verse of considerable virtuosity <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is one of Shakespeare’s least obviously poetical plays. In it his verbal powers are fully at the service of his overall dramatic aims. Often the situations require no more than swift, economical writing, carrying us along briskly from one comic point to the next. But Shakespeare, already a master of dramatic rhythm, knew that the pace would become wearisome if it remained unvaried. From time to time he relaxes the pace of the ongoing action to allow the inclusion of passages of comic writing in which the situation is not advanced but enlarged upon. Such is Dromio of Syracuse’s brilliant description of the kitchen wench who, mistaking him for his twin, presses her attentions upon him: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0886" targetEnd="#tln_0891">886–91</ref>].&hellip;[Dromio’s] comic catechism&hellip;preserves the comic tone while giving us a rest from following the complications of the action. Equally brilliant in a different way is Antipholus of Ephesus’s description of Dr Pinch and his efforts to cure him of his supposed madness: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1712" targetEnd="#tln_1717">1712–17</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><quote>In its matching of style to content, its dramatic economy, its tautness of construction, and its bold interfusion of farce with romance, <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> has claims to be considered as Shakespeare’s first real masterpiece.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1994"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> places <title level="m">Err.</title> in time after <title level="m">TGV</title> and <title level="m">Shr.</title></p>

<p>On the basis of the <hi rend="italic">abab</hi> rhymes as influenced by <title level="m">Ven.</title> and <title level="m">Luc.</title>, on the skillful casting for a smaller company following the establishment of the Lord Chamberlain’s men, and on the advance in character manipulation argued for by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bakg1907"><name type="app">Baker</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1994"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>, I believe that Sh. wrote the play after he joined the Chamberlain’s men in mid-1594, but well before December. If he did use Twine’s <title level="m">Patterne of Painefull Aduentures</title> (1594), as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_colh1993"><name type="app">Cole</name></ref> and others argue, that would settle the matter. The likely echoes of Marlowe, noted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1968"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> above, however, make 1592 a possibility, in the last few months before the closing of the theaters in May 1592. Likewise, the arguments for earlier dating by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1927"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_phip1966"><name type="app">Phialas</name></ref>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_evns"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_turr1974"><name type="app">Turner</name></ref>, and others have weight.</p>

<head>Sources and Influences</head>

<p>The commonly agreed on sources are Plautus’s <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>; the Bible, <rs type="bibleref">Acts 19</rs> and the Epistle to the Ephesians (not certainly one of Saint Paul’s compositions); the liturgy; and John Gower’s <title level="a">Apollonius of Tyre</title> (in Book 8 of the <title level="m">Confessio Amantis</title>). Although <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1957, vol. 1) does not include the biblical or liturgical passages, the rest are reprinted or excerpted by him: <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> in the 1595 version of William Warner; <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> in the translation of Edward Sugden, which lacks a passage known to Sh. included below; and <title level="a">Apollonius</title> in G. C. Macauley’s ed., different from the lines included below. Warner is reprinted quite often, e.g., <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hazw1874"><name type="app">Hazlitt</name></ref> (1874–6), <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard1a"><name type="app">Cuningham</name></ref> (ed. 1907), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ban2"><name type="app">Bevington</name></ref> (ed. 1988). <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962) summarizes the plots of <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>; he also prints extracts of Acts and Ephesians.</p>





<div type="level2" xml:id="div_plautus">
<head>Titus Maccius Plautus</head>

<p>While, so far as I know, everyone now agrees that Sh. read Latin well enough to study both <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>, there was a brisk debate about his ability that ran from the beginning of the 18th c. into the middle of the 20th c. Both the date of composition and Sh.’s reliance on Plautus are affected by how one decides the matter. The following summarizes the debate. Any uncertainty about Sh.’s Latinity was settled massively by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1944"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (1944), who also presents the 18th-c. positions with substantial abstracts (1:53–74).</p>

<p>Was Sh. a schoolmaster? <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 2:254) quotes John Aubrey, <title level="m">Brief Lives</title> ca. 1681: <quote>Though as Ben: Johnson sayes of him, that he had but little Latine and lesse Greek, He understood Latine pretty well: for he had been in his younger yeares a Schoolmaster in the Countrey. &lt;<hi rend="italic">In margin</hi>, <quote>from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> —— Beeston.</quote>&gt;</quote> Beeston is William, son of Christopher, a Chamberlain’s man with Sh. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adaj1923"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1923, pp. 94–5) champions this notion of Sh.’s occupation during the so-called Lost Years, between his marriage and the christenings of his three children in 1582–5, and 1592, when he is probably the object of Robert Greene’s attack as the <quote>only Shake-scene in a country</quote> in his <hi rend="italic">Groats-worth of witte</hi>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lang1691"><name type="app">Langbaine</name></ref> (1691, p. 455): <quote>This Play is founded on <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> his <title level="m">Mænechmi</title>: and if it [<title level="m">Err.</title>] be not a just Translation, ’tis at least a Paraphrase: and I think far beyond the Translation, call’d <title level="m">Menechmus</title>, which was printed 4o. <hi rend="italic">Lond.</hi> 1595.</quote> Langbaine seems to say that Sh. had enough Latin to make any use of Warner unnecessary, but his language is not as clear as one would like. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gilc1699"><name type="app">Gildon</name></ref> (1699, pp. 126–7): <quote>I am of Opinion, in spight of Mr. <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> [i.e., Ben Jonson],&hellip;that though perhaps he might not be that Critic in Latin and Greek as <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>; yet that he understood the former, so well as perfectly to be Master of their Histories.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">127</hi>] <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, a Comedy, <hi rend="italic">fol.</hi> The Ground from <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>, <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>, and <title level="m">Mænechmi</title>.</quote> He repeats and expands his opinion in 1710, p. 300. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_knt2"><name type="app">Knight</name></ref> (ed. 1842, p. 129): <quote>The commentators have puzzled themselves, after their usual fashion, with the evidence which this play undoubtedly presents of Shakspere’s ability to read Latin, and their dogged resolution to maintain the opinion that in an age of grammar-schools our poet never could have attained that common accomplishment.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_hal"><name type="app">Halliwell</name></ref> (ed. 1854, p. 445): <quote>[R.] Bentley, one of the publishers of the Comedy Mistaken Husband, 4to Lond. 1675&hellip;thus alludes to the Comedy of Errors in his address to the reader:—<quote>the resemblance of one man to another has not only been the foundation of this, but of many other plays. Plautus his Amphitrion was the original of all, and Shakespear and Moliere have copied him with success.</quote></quote></p>

<p>Those who do not think Sh. knew sufficient Latin include the following. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cape1783"><name type="app">Capell</name></ref> (1774, p. 70) speaks of <quote>the model he had to work upon,</quote> namely Warner, inventing an acquaintanceship between the two Warwickshire men, from whom Sh. probably gained his admirable knowledge of the classical unities. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1773"><name type="app">Steevens</name></ref> (ed. 1773, 2:165) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (ed. 1790, 1:289) likewise assume Sh. used Warner’s translation, perhaps because it circulated in manuscript before publication, as the title page says it did. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_farr1789"><name type="app">Farmer</name></ref> (1789, pp. 63–4), the most skeptical and persistent of the anti-Latinists: <quote>That the <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> is founded on the <title level="m">Menæchmi</title>, it is notorious: nor is it less so, that a Translation of it by W. W. perhaps <hi rend="italic">William Warner</hi>&hellip;was extant in the time of <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>; tho’ Mr. <hi rend="italic">Upton</hi>, [<hi rend="italic">64</hi>] and some other advocates for his [Sh.’s] learning, have cautiously dropt the mention of it.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_milj1885"><name type="app">Mills</name></ref> (1885, p. 189) in a lecture for the Bristol Shakspere Society, 24 Jan. 1885, denies that Sh. had read Plautus or Warner: <quote>Ben Jonson had read the <title level="m">Menæchini</title> [sic; always so spelled in this report], and from him Shakespeare doubtless learned the incidents of the play.</quote></p>






<div type="level3" xml:id="div_plautus_menaechmi">
<head><title level="m">Menaechmi</title></head>

<p>Warner’s translation of <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> was printed in 1595. Many early critics argue that Sh. used it as a source. Judgments about Sh.’s possible indebtedness will be found above, in Date of Composition. The translation is printed here as being the only contemporary translation and in lieu of the Latin that Sh. presumably knew but that most modern readers are unable to read. In the Commentary I have quoted <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref>’s (1930) parallels to the Latin play as an aid to those who wish to consult it (numbers to TLNs): <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0005" targetEnd="#tln_0034">5–34</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0035" targetEnd="#tln_0142">35–142</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0053" targetEnd="#tln_0061">53–61</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0110" targetEnd="#tln_0114">110–14</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0127" targetEnd="#tln_0142">127–42</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0131">131</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0171" targetEnd="#tln_0178">171–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0182" targetEnd="#tln_0184">182–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0197" targetEnd="#tln_0204">197–204</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0205" targetEnd="#tln_0260">205–60</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0208" targetEnd="#tln_0232">208–32</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0208" targetEnd="#tln_0217">208–17</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0218" targetEnd="#tln_0260">218–60</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0261" targetEnd="#tln_0271">261–71</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0275" targetEnd="#tln_0277">275–7</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0278" targetEnd="#tln_0317">278–317</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0363" targetEnd="#tln_0392">363–92</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0402" targetEnd="#tln_0403">402–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0421" targetEnd="#tln_0423">421–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0505" targetEnd="#tln_0541">505–41</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0542" targetEnd="#tln_0543">542–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0547" targetEnd="#tln_0548">547–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0562" targetEnd="#tln_0564">562–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0575" targetEnd="#tln_0615">575–615</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0602" targetEnd="#tln_0604">602–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0619" targetEnd="#tln_0651">619–51</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0624" targetEnd="#tln_0628">624–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0651" targetEnd="#tln_0745">651–745</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0768" targetEnd="#tln_0782">768–82</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0787" targetEnd="#tln_0814">787–814</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0873" targetEnd="#tln_0879">873–9</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0946" targetEnd="#tln_0979">946–79</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0959">959</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0982" targetEnd="#tln_1072">982–1072</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1101" targetEnd="#tln_1102">1101–2</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1184" targetEnd="#tln_1194">1184–94</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1196" targetEnd="#tln_1226">1196–1226</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1228" targetEnd="#tln_1263">1228–63</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1323" targetEnd="#tln_1363">1323–63</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1392">1392</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1396" targetEnd="#tln_1397">1396–7</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1398" targetEnd="#tln_1424">1398–1424</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1448" targetEnd="#tln_1461">1448–61</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1505" targetEnd="#tln_1536">1505–36</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1537" targetEnd="#tln_1581">1537–81</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1813" targetEnd="#tln_1826">1813–26</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1816" targetEnd="#tln_1918">1816–1918</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1827" targetEnd="#tln_1847">1827–47</ref>.</p>

<p>Warner’s translation follows the Latin quite closely in lively, idiomatic prose. He does not translate about 75 lines, spread out over the 1,162 lines of the Latin text, and gives brief paraphrases of two passages that total 17 lines. It is an eminently actable translation, but I have found no contemporary references to it. Warner bowdlerizes Plautus a bit by removing some lines of sexual innuendo and by translating <quote xml:lang="la">meretrix</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la">scortum</quote> as <quote>Gentlewoman</quote> or <quote>woman.</quote></p>

<p>The quarto is well printed; a few editorial adjustments are in square brackets. So as to make placement of signatures and other references most visible, the text preserves the lineation of Q, except for sigs.

<p>[Warner does not translate the Prologue, which is taken here from Nixon (tr. 1917, 2:367, 369, 371).]</p>

<p>First and foremost, spectators, I am the bearer of the very best wishes for—myself and—you. I bring you Plautus, orally, not corporally, and I pray you receive him with amiable ears. Lend me your attention and learn our argument now; I will frame it in the fewest possible words.</p>

<p>Now writers of comedy have this habit: they always allege that the scene of action is Athens, their object being to give the play a more Grecian air. As for me, I will report the scene as being nowhere, save where, by report, the events occurred. And though this argument is à la Greek, yet it is not à l’Attic but rather à la Sicilian. So much by way of antelude to this argument; now I will give you your rations of the argument itself, not by the peck or three peck measure, but by the very granary—such is my generosity in giving arguments!</p>

<p>There was a certain old merchant in Syracuse who had twin sons born him, so much alike that their foster mother who suckled them could not distinguish them, nor even their real mother who gave them birth—so I was told, at least, by a man who had seen the boys; I myself have not seen them, and none of you is to suppose I have. When the boys were now seven years old, their father loaded a large ship with many articles of [<hi rend="italic">369</hi>] merchandise; one twin he put aboard and took away with himself to Tarentum, his place of trade, the other being left with his mother at home. At Tarentum it happened they were having a festival when he arrived. Many people had congregated, as they do at festivals; the boy strayed from his father in the crowd. A certain merchant of Epidamnus was there; this merchant picked the boy up and took him off to Epidamnus. As for the father, after he lost his son he was broken-hearted and died of grief at Tarentum a few days later.</p>

<p>When news of all this—how the boy was stolen and his father dead at Tarentum—got back to Syracuse to the boys’ grandfather, he changed the name of this other twin. See what a deep affection he had for that other boy, the stolen one! He gave that boy’s name to the one at home, calling him Menaechmus, the name of his lost brother. This was the name of the grandfather himself, too,—(<hi rend="italic">confidentially</hi>) I remember his name the more easily for having seen him vociferously dunned. To keep you from going astray later, I herewith forewarn you—both twins have the same name.</p>

<p>Now I must (<hi rend="italic">chuckling</hi>) foot it back to Epidamnus so as to clarify this situation for you perfectly. If any one of you should want any business transacted for him in Epidamnus, command me freely and speak out—that is, in case you furnish the wherewithal for the transaction. For if a man has not furnished the necessary funds, it will come to nothing; if he has furnished them, it will come to—less than nothing. However, I return to the place I left, yes, and without stirring a step.</p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">371</hi>] That Epidamnian I mentioned some time ago, who stole that other twin, had no children at all except his money. He adopted that kidnapped boy and gave him a wife with a dowry, and made him his heir by his own demise. For he happened one day to be going to the country after a heavy rain, and while he was trying to ford a rapid stream quite near the city, the rapids rapt the feet of the boy’s abductor from beneath him and swept him off to perdition. His enormous fortune fell to his adopted son. And there it is (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the house</hi>) that this stolen twin lives.</p>

<p>Now that twin whose home is in Syracuse will come to-day to Epidamnus, with his servant, in search of this twin brother of his. This city (<hi rend="italic">with a wave toward the houses on the stage</hi>) is Epidamnus, during the presentation of this play; when another play is presented it will become another town. It is quite like the way in which families, too, are wont to change their homes: now a pimp lives here, now a young gentleman, now an old one, now a poor man, a beggar, a king, a parasite, a seer[.]</p>

<lb/>reason is, these poore wretches enduring one miserie vpon an other,
<lb/>neuer cease deuising how by wrenching asunder their giues, or
<lb/>by some subtiltie or other they may escape such cursed bands.
<lb/>If then ye would keep a man without all suspition of running

<lb/>and ease: Let him euer be idle, eate his belly full, and carouse

<lb/>of iron, steele, or what mettall so euer, for the more slack and
<lb/>easie ye make them, the faster still they tie the partie which is
<lb/>in them. I speake this vpon experience of my selfe, who am

<head><title level="m">Amphitruo</title> and the Supposita</head>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, p. xxvii) summarizes the plot of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>: <quote>Jupiter takes the place of Amphitryon in his house, and sleeps with his wife, Alcmena, who believes she is with her husband. Meanwhile, Mercury adopts the appearance of Amphitryon’s slave, Sosia, and first confuses, then drives away the real Sosia. A little later, Mercury, still Sosia in appearance, abuses Amphitryon when he knocks at the door of his own house and is not allowed to enter. In this play there are two pairs of twins, masters and servants, who cannot be distinguished by their friends or by Alcmena.</quote></p>

<p>What has not been printed for about a century is an addition to the authentic <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> to make up for a lacuna between 4.2.16 and the beginning of Act 5, a gap of about 225 lines. The addition, written by Hermolaus Barbarus, was printed in 16th-c. editions, one of which Sh. presumably studied. In Lambinus’s ed. (1576), which <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928 #b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> identifies as the one Sh. read (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0000">0</ref>), the first few lines are printed in italics, with a warning that the best manuscripts do not contain the addition, but that Lambinus intends to print the lines, <quote xml:lang="la">siue sint Plauti, siue non sint.</quote> This addition came to be called Supposita in 19th-c. scholarly editions in recognition of its being a late, non-Plautine text, or else it was dropped as spurious, so that the lines have been ignored in more recent source studies. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref> (1930, pp. 52–5): <quote part="I">This reconstruction was made by Hermolaus Barbarus, Cardinal of Aquileja (1464–1493), to be used when the <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> was played in Rome and Florence.&hellip;The author of <title level="m">The Birth of Hercules</title> (about 1600) follows quite closely these reconstructed scenes, translating or paraphrasing the greater part of them.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">53</hi>] It seems very probable to me that Shakespeare was familiar with them.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">54</hi>] <quote part="M">In studying these characters I have suggested that the rôle of Balthazar&hellip;is not unlike that of Blepharo [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0755" targetEnd="#tln_0758">755–8</ref> of the authentic text].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">55</hi>] <quote part="F">The altercation over the closed door, the talk of sorcery and transformation, Amphitruo’s doubting his identity, and, more particularly, Blepharo’s activity as peacemaker, are suggestive of Shakespeare’s play, and of this interpolation.</quote></p>

<p>The following prose translation (tr. <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_plat1852">Riley</ref>, 1910, pp. 47–57) of the lines added to 16th-c. editions of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> is used because no modern editions include the Supposita. The addition begins after line 1034. Italicized words are not in the Latin, but are added by Riley to achieve clarity or idiomatic English. No standard line numbering exists; page numbers in brackets are those of the translation. TLN references inserted in the text identify nn. that discuss the Supposita. I reprint the whole passage because Sh. would have read it (in Latin) and because of its rarity.</p>

<sp><speaker>Merc.</speaker><p>Amphitryon? Are you in your senses? Has it not been told you before, old fellow, that you have been playing the Bacchanal, to be asking another person who you are? Get away, I recommend you, don’t be troublesome while Amphitryon, who has just come back from the enemy, is indulging himself with <hi rend="italic">the company of</hi> his wife.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>What man?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Merc.</speaker><p>How often do you want it told? Amphitryon, my master; —don’t be troublesome.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Merc.</speaker><p>Yes, as I fancy, he is sleeping with her side by side.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Merc.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">to the</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Audience</hi>).</stage> It <hi rend="italic">really</hi> is a gain which he imagines to be a misfortune.

<sp><speaker>Merc.</speaker><p>You are Bacchus <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> not Amphitryon. How often do you want to be told? Any times more? My <hi rend="italic">master</hi> Amphitryon, in the same chamber, is holding Alcmena in his embraces. If you persist, I’ll produce him here, and not without your great discomfiture.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>I wish him to be fetched. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">Aside.</hi>)</stage> I pray that this day, in return for my services, I may not lose house, wife, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> household, together with my figure.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>What’s this, Sosia? Great marvels are these that you are telling of. Do you say that you found another Sosia at home exactly like yourself?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>I do say <hi rend="italic">so</hi>—but, hark you, since I <hi rend="italic">have produced</hi> a Sosia, Amphitryon an Amphitryon, how do you know whether you, perchance, may not be producing another Blepharo? O that the Gods would grant that you as well, belaboured with fists, and with your teeth knocked out, going without your breakfast, might credit this. For I, that other Sosia, <hi rend="italic">that is to say</hi>, who am yonder, has mauled me in a dreadful manner.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Really, it is wonderful; but it’s as well to mend our pace; for, as I perceive, Amphitryon is waiting for us, and my empty stomach is grumbling.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">apart</hi>)</stage>.—And why do I mention foreign legends? More wondrous things they relate <hi rend="italic">to have happened</hi> among our Theban race in former days; that mighty searcher for Europa, attacking the monster sprung from Mars, suddenly produced his enemies from the serpent-seed; and in that battle fought, brother pressed on brother with lance and helm; the Epirote land, too, beheld the author of our race, together with the daughter of Venus, gliding as serpents. From on high supreme Jove thus willed it; thus destiny directs. All the noblest of our country, in return for their bright achievements, are pursued with direful woes. This fatality is pressing hard on me—<hi rend="italic">still</hi> I could endure disasters so great, and submit to woes hardly to be endured—</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>Blepharo.</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>What’s the matter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>I don’t know; I suspect something wrong.</p></sp>

<sp><milestone unit="page_amph" n="51" xml:id="amph_p_51">[<hi rend="italic">51</hi>]</milestone><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Why?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>Look, please, our master, <hi rend="italic">like</hi> an humble courtier, is walking before the door bolted fast.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>It’s nothing; walking to and fro, he’s looking for an appetite.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>After a singular fashion, indeed; for he has shut the door, that it mayn’t escape out of the house.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>You do go yelping on.</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>I go neither yelping on nor barking on; if you listen to me, observe him. I don’t know why <hi rend="italic">he’s</hi> by himself alone; he’s making some calculation, I suppose. I can hear from this spot what he says—don’t be in a hurry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">apart</hi>)</stage>. How much I fear lest the Gods should blot out the glory I have acquired in the conquest of the foe. In wondrous manner do I see the whole of my household in commotion. And then my wife, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> full of viciousness, incontinence, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> dishonor, kills me outright. But about the goblet, it is a singular thing; yet the seal was properly affixed. And what besides? She recounted to me the battles I had fought; Pterelas, too, besieged and bravely slain by my own hand. Aye, aye—now I know the trick; this was done by Sosia’s contrivance, who as well has disgracefully presumed to-day to get before me on my arrival.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">to</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Blepharo</hi>)</stage>. He’s talking about me, and in terms that I had rather not. Prithee, don’t let’s accost <hi rend="italic">this</hi> man until he has disclosed his wrath.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Just as you please.</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">apart</hi>)</stage>. If it is granted me this day to lay hold of that whip-scoundrel, I’ll show him what it is to deceive his master, and to assail me with threats and tricks.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>Do you hear him?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>I hear him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>That implement <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">pointing to</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Amphitryon</hi>’s <hi rend="italic">walking-stick</hi>)</stage> is a burden for my shoulder-blades. Let’s accost the <milestone unit="page_amph" n="52" xml:id="amph_p_52">[<hi rend="italic">52</hi>]</milestone>man, if you please. Do you know what is in the habit of being commonly said?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>What you are going to say, I don’t know; what you’ll have to endure I pretty well guess.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>It’s an old adage—<quote>Hunger and delay summon anger to the nostrils.</quote></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Aye, and well suited to the occasion. Let’s address him directly—Amphitryon!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">looking round</hi>)</stage>. Is it Blepharo I hear? It’s strange why he’s come to me. Still, he presents himself opportunely, for me to prove the guilty conduct of my wife. Why <hi rend="italic">have you come</hi> here to me, Blepharo?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Have you so soon forgotten how early in the morning you sent Sosia to the ship, that I might take a repast with you to-day?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Never in this world was it done. But where is that scoundrel?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Who?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Sosia.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>See, there he is. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">Points at him.</hi>)</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">looking about</hi>)</stage>. Where?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Before your eyes; don’t you see him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>I can hardly see for anger, so distracted has that fellow made me this day. You shall never escape my making a sacrifice of you. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">Offers to strike</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Sosia</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on which</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Blepharo</hi> <hi rend="italic">prevents him.</hi>)</stage> Do let me, Blepharo.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Listen, I pray.</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Say on, I’m listening—<stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">gives a blow to</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Sosia</hi>)</stage> you take that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>For what reason? Am I not in good time? I couldn’t have gone quicker, if I had betaken myself on the oarlike wings of Dædalus. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="lscaps">Amphitryon</hi> <hi rend="italic">tries to strike him again.</hi>)</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Prithee, do leave him alone; we couldn’t quicken our pace any further.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Whether it was <hi rend="italic">the pace</hi> of a man on stilts or that <milestone unit="page_amph" n="53" xml:id="amph_p_53">[<hi rend="italic">53</hi>]</milestone>of the tortoise, I’m determined to be the death of this villain. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">Striking him at each sentence.</hi>)</stage> Take that for the roof; that for the tiles; that for closing the door; that for making fun of your master; that for your abusive language.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>What injury has he been doing to you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Do you ask? Shut out of doors, from that housetop <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>)</stage> he has driven me away from my house.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>What, I?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>What did you threaten that you would do if I knocked at that door? Do you deny it, you scoundrel?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>Why shouldn’t I deny it? See, he’s sufficiently a witness with whom I have <hi rend="italic">just now</hi> come; I was sent on purpose that by your invitation I might bring him to your house.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Who sent you, villain?</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>He who asks me the question.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>When, of all things?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>Some little time since—not long since—just now. When you were reconciled at home to your wife.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Bacchus must have demented you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>May I not be paying my respects to Bacchus this day, nor yet to Ceres. You ordered the vessels to be made clean, that you might perform a sacrifice, and you sent me to fetch him <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">pointing to</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Blepharo</hi>)</stage>, that he might breakfast with you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Blepharo, may I perish outright if I have either been in the house, or if I have sent him. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">To</hi> <hi rend="lscaps">Sosia</hi>)</stage> Tell me—where did you leave me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p>At home, with your wife Alcmena. Leaving you, I flew towards the harbour, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> invited him in your name. We are come, and I’ve not seen you since till now.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Villanous fellow! With my wife, <hi rend="italic">say you?</hi> You shall never go away without getting a beating. <stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">Gives him a blow.</hi>)</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sos.</speaker><p><stage type="description">(<hi rend="italic">crying out</hi>)</stage>. Blepharo!</p></sp><sp rend="inline"><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>Amphitryon, do let him alone, for my sake, and listen to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Amph.</speaker><p>Well, then, I’ll let him alone. What do you want? Say on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bleph.</speaker><p>He has just now been telling me most extraordinary marvels.

<head>Shakespeare’s Use of Plautus</head>



<div type="level4" xml:id="div_plautus_indebtedness">
<head>General Indebtedness</head>

<p>To begin with Sh.’s debt to Plautus’s <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> beyond the mere notice of additions and subtractions such as <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_herw1870"><name type="app">Hertzberg</name></ref> (ed. 1870, 8:189) offers (wife’s father, parasite, cook, and maid missing from <title level="m">Err.</title>; Solinus, Egeon, Balthazar, Angelo, the Abbess, Luciana, and especially the second Dromio added to <title level="m">Err.</title>), the fullest exposition is <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref>’s (1930), which lays out the parallels so well that no one has had to redo the project. Her conclusion sensibly claims that Sh. (p. 59) <quote>seems to have assimilated thoroughly the two classical comedies; he has made a remarkable—probably unconscious—selection of details, has added to these some entirely new elements and a touch, at the beginning and the end, of an old tale, and has moulded the whole into an excellently plotted play.</quote> This modest description does much to deflect objections that she has found detailed influences which, if she were to have said they were entirely conscious manipulations of the two plays, would have defied credibility.</p>

<p>Whether Sh. used Warner rather than Latin Plautus causes comment, as the issue of Sh.’s Latinity mentioned above demonstrates. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ritj0001"><name type="app">Ritson</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1793"><name type="app">Steevens</name></ref>, ed. 1793): <quote>I am possibly singular in thinking that Shakspeare was not under the slightest obligation, in forming this comedy, to Warner’s translation of the <title level="m">Menæchmi</title>.&hellip; He has not a name, line or word, from the old play, nor any incident but what must, of course, be common to every translation.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_isah1884a"><name type="app">Isaac</name></ref> (1884, p. 28), after comparing many parallel passages in Warner and <title level="m">Err.</title>—most are too faint to be useful—and after comparing the treatment of the characters common to both plays, concludes that Sh.’s play is the altogether richer version, even if Sh. knew Warner; he does not consider the Latin play. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard1a"><name type="app">Cuningham</name></ref> (ed. 1907, pp. xxv ff.) gathers 14 passages from Warner <quote>which may be considered with much reason to have been in Shakespeare’s mind when engaged on the composition of his <title level="m">Errors</title>.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (ed. 1928, p. xvii n.): <quote>A curious illustration of Warner’s stage eye is the <hi rend="italic">spinter</hi> of Plautus, which Cooper defines as <quote>A&hellip;bracelet.</quote> But a bracelet is not spectacular enough for the stage duty to which Shakespeare wishes to put this piece of jewelry, so he changes it to a chain, seemingly of aldermanic proportions, to be worn with flaunting visibility around the neck. And a chain it becomes in Warner, for no apparent reason unless it be whim, or an echo of Shakespeare.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tans1932"><name type="app">Tannenbaum</name></ref> (1932, pp. 103–5) adds phrases from Warner that have counterparts in <title level="m">Err.</title>: <quote>pulses beate so sore</quote> (<ptr targType="sp" target="#sp_0014"/> above; TLN <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1336">1336</ref>); <quote>his eies sparkle: they rowle in his head; his colour goes and comes: he lookes wildly</quote> (<ptr targType="sp" target="#sp_0013"/>; TLN <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1381">1381</ref>); and <quote>threatens to pull out mine eyes</quote> (<ptr targType="sp" target="#sp_0020"/>; TLN <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1392">1392</ref>).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xxv f.): <quote>It is possible that Shakespeare had seen [Warner].&hellip;It is written in lively prose, and reveals some parallels with <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, for example, in echoes of words like patch [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0654">654</ref>], stale [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0377">377</ref>], and harlots [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1682">1682</ref>]; in an emphasis on madness; in the suggestion that [<hi rend="italic">xxvi</hi>] Erotium is a witch (this is not in the Latin); and in the phrase <quote>birds that bear feathers, or fishes that have fins</quote> (Latin <quote xml:lang="la">avis squamosas, piscis pennatos,</quote> l. 918; i.e. birds with scales, fish with feathers), which could have suggested the line, [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0743">743</ref>].</quote> He notices the substitution of the chain for Plautus’s bracelet (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0382">382</ref>). <quote>However, even those who have made as much as possible of the verbal similarities have not been able to build up a convincing case that Shakespeare knew Warner’s translation; indeed, the reverse could be true, that Warner echoed Shakespeare.</quote></p>

<p>No recent commentator believes that Sh. used Warner rather than Plautus.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gilc1699"><name type="app">Gildon</name></ref>’s acknowledgment of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> above is noticed apparently only by <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (ed. 1928, p. xx n.). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1965b"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (<title level="m">Genetics</title>, 1965, p. 210): <quote>The earliest reference works had connected <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> with <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> as sources of <title level="m">Errors</title>. But the connection dropped out of the eighteenth-century tradition and was halfheartedly reinstated only in the second half of the nineteenth. The early reference works, however, had not specified the details of the relationship. The first to specify both the doubled twins and the shut-out husband was Moritz Rapp [in <title level="m">Shakspere</title>, ed. Keller &amp; Rapp, 1843, 7:3–4].</quote></p>

<p>Occasionally, the influence of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> reappears. In addition to <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_hal"><name type="app">Halliwell</name></ref> (ed. 1854, p. 445) above are the following: <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kliw1873"><name type="app">Klingelhöffer</name></ref> (1873, p. 20): The idea of adding twin slaves&hellip;is probably taken from the <title level="m">Amphitryon</title> (Fr.). He predates <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wisp1879"><name type="app">Wislicenus</name></ref> (1879), who now is usually credited with this <quote>discovery.</quote> Wislicenus particularly points (p. 91) to two lines from the Supposita, <quote xml:lang="la" xml:id="quote_app_001">Tun’, furcifur, meis procul prohibessis aedibus? | Tun’ meas pulsare foreis? hasce illico toto demoliar cardine</quote> (<quote type="trans" corresp="#quote_app_001">What, rascal, would you be for driving me away from my own house? What, <hi rend="italic">would you hinder me</hi> from knocking at my own door. I’ll this instant tear it from off all its hinges</quote>; <ptr targType="sp" target="#sp_0008"/>). He likens them to <title level="m">Err.</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0729">729</ref>. See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0729-02">729</ref>. For other similarities in the authentic play that he points to, see nn. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0002-01">2</ref>, <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0209">209–59</ref>, <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0651-01">651–745</ref>, <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0864">864–5</ref>, <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1343">1343–8</ref>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref> (<title level="a">Evolution,</title> 1926, p. 625) cautions against thinking the use of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> is merely that of adding the doubled servants and the lock-out scene to the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>: <quote>A fairer statement would be that the two plots have been combined to the marked modification of both, and have also been very considerably amplified.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wisp1879"><name type="app">Wislicenus</name></ref> was not regularly noticed until <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref> (1930, p. 15) made such oversight unthinkable, unless one wished to deny the influence of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>; it had not yet been translated into English and hence presumably could not be read by a Sh. who supposedly could not read Latin. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_couw1903"><name type="app">Courthope</name></ref> (1903, p. 79) thinks he is the first to name <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> as a source. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ducg1952"><name type="app">Duckworth</name></ref> (1952, pp. 412–13) believes that an English translation of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> was made in 1562–3, but he is mistaken. He is followed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_riew1990"><name type="app">Riehle</name></ref> (1990, p. 36).</p>

<p>How much or whether Alcmena influenced Sh.’s characterization of Adriana is lightly argued. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref> (1930, pp. 34 ff.) marks the parallels between the two without comment. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1965b"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (<title level="m">Genetics</title>, 1965, p. 211): <quote>Certainly Adriana is in no way imitated from Alcmena.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mior1994"><name type="app">Miola</name></ref> (1994, pp. 29–30): <quote><title level="m">Amphitruo</title> also supplies Shakespeare with Alcmena, pious [<hi rend="italic">30</hi>] <hi rend="italic">matrona</hi>, who elevates Adriana beyond the merely dull or shrewish stereotype. The rhetoric of accusation and protest between husband and wife in <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> inspires several confrontations in <title level="m">Errors</title>.</quote> He cites Gill (1930), who lists all the parallels between <title level="m">Err.</title> and <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> (numbers are to TLNs): <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0209" targetEnd="#tln_0259">209–59</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0263" targetEnd="#tln_0268">263–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0530">530</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0608" targetEnd="#tln_0610">608–10</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0624" targetEnd="#tln_0637">624–37</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0629">629</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0729">729</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0755" targetEnd="#tln_0767">755–67</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1074" targetEnd="#tln_1097">1074–97</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1343" targetEnd="#tln_1348">1343–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1349" targetEnd="#tln_1388">1349–88</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1367" targetEnd="#tln_1368">1367–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1389">1389</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1666" targetEnd="#tln_1670">1666–70</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1680" targetEnd="#tln_1682">1680–2</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1684" targetEnd="#tln_1686">1684–6</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1858" targetEnd="#tln_1877">1858–77</ref>.</p>

<p>In considering the influence of other Plautine plays, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_enkp1920"><name type="app">Enk</name></ref> (1920, pp. 362–3) compares <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0741">741</ref> with <title level="m">Captivi</title> 1002 (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0744">744</ref>) and, less certainly, <quote>foot-ball</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0359">359</ref>) with <title level="m">Captivi</title> 368 <quote xml:lang="la" xml:id="quote_app_002">pro rota me uti licet</quote> (<quote type="trans" corresp="#quote_app_002">You can use me like a hoop</quote>), where <quote>rota</quote> is usually translated <quote>wheel</quote> (tr. Nixon, 1917, 1:497).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_phip1966"><name type="app">Phialas</name></ref> (1966, pp. 7–9): <quote>In the <title level="m">Captivi</title> the father’s name is Hegio, which Shakespeare could easily have turned to Egeon, although&hellip;the exact form of the name may have come from the legends of Theseus and his father Aegeus, King of Athens.</quote> He tells the <title level="m">Captivi</title> story of a father losing two sons, one stolen, the other taken prisoner in war. After a long-delayed reconciliation comes a passage in which Hegio displays a (p. 8) <quote part="I">clash of emotions&hellip;when it is revealed that one of the prisoners is his own long-lost son. The passage&hellip;is one that would have appealed strongly to Shakespeare.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Another feature of the <title level="m">Captivi</title> which would have impressed a young dramatist is the play’s structure, which Lessing called the best in existence.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">9</hi>] <quote part="F">In the <title level="m">Captivi</title> Shakespeare would have found much to interest him, especially the accommodation of sentiment as well as conflict and powerful emotion in a comic structure.&hellip;Although it is true that family reunion and reconciliation is very common in the prose romances&hellip;, [it] is certainly a major element of the <title level="m">Captivi</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_artj1971"><name type="app">Arthos</name></ref> (1971, pp. 151 ff.) adds Plautus’s <title level="m">Rudens</title> in the process of showing that Sh. did more than merely multiply the incidents of the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>: <quote part="I">He let us know that some power was at work in these misadventures and in their very multiplicity, or at least that there were grounds for supposing so; and the audience, so differently from that attending to Plautus, is being brought to think of all this as somehow the demonstration of mysterious influences making use of the confusion, turning it all to good.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">154</hi>] <quote part="F">Plautus himself had an uncommonly fine sense of the tenderness as well as the strength of human love, and I think he gave Shakespeare the lead he wanted on this very matter although he himself could not have conceived of the happiness Shakespeare took into view. The hint for bringing this unearthly loveliness into this high-spirited comedy came from another of Plautus’s, the <title level="m">Rudens</title>. Here there is a scene like that with which <title level="m">The Tempest</title> was to begin, where two men from the shore are watching a storm tear a ship to pieces. They see survivors, two women, cast loose on a raft, and as it turns out these are being saved for a glorious fate.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_riew1990"><name type="app">Riehle</name></ref> (1990) devotes his book to demonstrating (p. 3) <quote>that Shakespeare&hellip;made a close study of the classical tradition</quote> at the beginning of his career, especially an exhaustive study of all Plautus’s plays. He strongly denies <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>’s emphasis on Terence as an influence, and in this respect Riehle needs studying to help students balance the massive scholarship and emphatic certainty of Baldwin. But in his way Riehle is as certain as Baldwin that he can trace to Plautus the sources for major and minor aspects of <title level="m">Err.</title> He credits Sh. with a level of classical attainments that is not credible, as for example when he derives Erotes and Errotis from the Greek (p. 178) <quote><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρωτάω</foreign> <quote>to ask,</quote> <quote>to try to find out.</quote> The proper form of the name would then be <quote>Erotetes,</quote> but the contraction may be explained as a case of haplology.&hellip;This cognomen has to be seen in the light of other Shakespearean names of Greek [<hi rend="italic">179</hi>] origin, such as, for example, Ophelia and Sycorax. In any case, it is an astonishing instance of Shakespeare’s erudition.</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> [1947, p. 697] makes the same claim for <quote>to ask,</quote> only to abandon it.) Excesses such as this and others, equally implausible, about the names are compensated for by careful, detailed readings of Plautus and <title level="m">Err.</title> where it is often likely that Sh. responded to patterns of theme and structure that a sensitive playwright might absorb.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mior1994"><name type="app">Miola</name></ref> (1994, pp. 18, 22): <quote>Like Plautus and Terence themselves, Shakespeare continually reformulates and interrogates his New Comedic heritage.&hellip;Throughout his works Shakespeare creatively adapts New Comedic dramaturgy.&hellip;Dramatic devices like the lock-out, disguise, and eavesdropping appear in strange translations as do familiar New Comedic configurations: the blocking father, his daughter, her lover; the clever slave and master; the importunate lover and worldly courtesan; the reunion of parent and child. As always, classical elements, present in different degrees in different plays, combine with non-classical ones—the Bible, medieval literature, the Italian novella, contemporary fiction and drama—not in static co-existence but dynamic interaction.</quote></p>

<p>Instead of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref>’s double columns comparing <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and <title level="m">Err.</title>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mior1994"><name type="app">Miola</name></ref> shows Sh. ranging over the plot and character elements of Plautus and Terence generally, using them in whatever new combinations he needs; Sh. has been saturated with New Comedy, not just two plays. (P. 22): <quote>Although no one would deny Shakespeare’s general indebtedness to Plautus in this play, the specific tally of debits and credits has occasioned some dispute. Because the two Dromios&hellip;sport Italian names&hellip;some have thought them Italianate rather than Plautine. But not every classical slave is <hi rend="italic">callidus</hi>; many, including Messenio of <title level="m">Menæchmi</title> and Sosia of <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>, are humorous victims of abuse and misunderstanding. Moreover, the two Dromios continually replay jokes and routines from New Comedy,</quote> such as complaining about obeying orders, yearning for freedom, running breathless onstage, using the rope as a stage prop after the convention of calling people <quote>mastigia</quote> (one who deserves a whipping), and so on, elements taken from other plays than <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>. His chapter complements Gill, making it even clearer that Sh. could not have been solely dependent on Warner’s translation to produce <title level="m">Err.</title></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rudn1994"><name type="app">Rudd</name></ref> (1994) attractively compares the Plautus plays and <title level="m">Err.</title>, as well as remarking on how Sh. adapted the romance and Plautine traditions.

<p>(P. 80): <quote>There are sixteen characters (besides the gaoler, officer, etc.) in Shakespeare’s play in contrast to the ten in the play of Plautus.

<p>She thinks that Luciana partly fulfills the function of the father in the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> in that (p. 92) <quote>the old man champions the husband’s liberty, chides the wife for her jealous nagging, but is fair enough to see that the husband also is to blame</quote> in 5.2.785–805.</p>

<p>Summarizing, she says (p. 93): <quote part="I">1. Shakespeare has added to his characters traits which are lacking in those of Plautus, and thus he makes them more complex and more human; as, for example, to Antipholus of Syracuse he has given morality, honesty, and sentiment, and in Adriana he has added to the jealousy and temper of the wife womanly qualities of which there is no suggestion in [Plautus].</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">2. He has used one character as a foil for another: he contrasts Adriana and Luciana, Antipholus of Ephesus and Antipholus of Syracuse, and to a less degree, the two Dromios.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">3. He has seized upon some of the most human traits in the characters of Plautus—sometimes little more than suggested—and intensified them, such as the serious-mindedness and the melancholy of the twin who seeks his brother; the charm and ability of the married brother, as evidenced by his popularity and his business reputation; and the affection of slave for master.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">94</hi>] <quote part="F">4.

Considerably more prominence was given by Shakespeare to the other twin, and Antipholus of Syracuse has nearly a hundred lines more than his brother, as well as a more sympathetic rôle, which includes the wooing of Luciana.

<p>[<hi rend="italic">xxvi</hi>] <quote part="F">The most direct link between <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> is the use of the terms Surreptus (Sereptus) and Errotis (Erotes) to describe respectively Antipholus of Ephesus and his twin of Syracuse.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hama1967"><name type="app">Hamilton</name></ref> (1967, pp. 91–5, 101–3): <quote part="I">An emphasis upon plot may seem inevitable in a play that derives from both Plautus’ boisterous intrigue and Terence’s complicated action, especially for an Elizabethan dramatist with his love of variety in action. Yet the decision to imitate the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> involves Shakespeare in a problem of structure. Plautus’ plot is episodic, or, in Aristotle’s terms, simple rather than complex (<title level="m">Poetics</title> 1452<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>12), and superficial in the sense of lying upon the narrative level in the repetition of episodes involving mistaken identity. An error results from a previous error, and each follows the other mechanically until, after all possibilities have been exhausted, the brothers are brought together upon the stage.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">92</hi>] Lacking any logic of its own, the play substitutes for a plot the mathematical possibilities of error inherent in the comic situation of a twin’s being mistaken for his identical brother.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">In avoiding this danger, his play illustrates Aristotle’s rules that the change of fortune that resolves the action—here the meeting of the two brothers—should involve recognition combined with peripety, and that both should result from the construction of the plot (<title level="m">Poetics</title> 1452<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>14–20). Consequently, the plot expresses his idea of comedy and becomes the soul of a play he ambitiously terms THE <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title>.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Shakespeare shapes his entire comedy most obviously through the device of Egeon’s tragic story, which serves as both the point of departure and the resolution of the comedy of errors.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">93</hi>] Egeon’s story becomes the prologue or argument to the comedy of errors in the sense that the comedy will reverse his tragic fall.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Plautus is significant in showing Shakespeare what to avoid. In place of a mechanical repetition of mistaken identity&hellip;Shakespeare seeks dramatic complexity. A comparison of the episodes where the wife meets her husband illustrates this point. In Plautus, the comic situation presents a simple domestic quarrel: through Peniculus’ spite, an angry [<hi rend="italic">94</hi>] wife accuses an embarrassed and blustering husband of stealing her cloak. She rages, he lies, and the Parasite enjoys his revenge.&hellip;When Shakespeare imitates this episode, he offers, in place of a comedy of situation, a complex drama of human confusion in which the wife sees her husband and servant conspiring against her, the husband sees his wife and servant conspiring against him, and the servant remains confounded between them. Each speaks the truth, yet appears to lie, and the episode ends in bafflement, rage, and growing madness.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">95</hi>] <quote part="F">To have error culminate in madness is one means by which Shakespeare imposes form upon the comic device of mistaken identity. Taking the hint from Plautus, where both brothers are accused of being mad, he applies it directly to Antipholus of Ephesus.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hama1967"><name type="app">Hamilton</name></ref> concentrates on madness, E.

It is notable, for example, that the courtesan has a more important role in the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> than in [<title level="m">Err.</title>]. In spite of Renaissance assumptions about the moral function of comedy&hellip;there is not the faintest sign that Plautus disapproved of his hero’s conduct.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shac1980"><name type="app">Shaw</name></ref> (1980, pp. 18–21): <quote>For it is upon such knowledge [of Sh.’s narrative sources for <title level="m">Err.</title>] that we can base our assessment of the freedom with which Shakespeare adapted and added and also come to recognize when he broke with direct or indirect Plautine influence to adopt other dramatic methods and style, particularly those of Terence,</quote> whose plays contain fully developed double plots. <quote>I would like to suggest that Shakespeare, whose knowledge of Plautus and Terence was as great as theirs had been of Menander and Apollodorus, took the same liberties with Plautine narrative and with Terence’s interlocking double plots as Terence had done with his Greek forebears and that this freedom opened the way for an even greater expansion of that <quote>comic complication</quote> and character illumination of which [Richard] Levin speaks [<title level="m">The Multiple Plot in English Renaissance Drama</title>]. The result is that in Shakespeare’s play there are not two, but <hi rend="italic">three</hi> levels of dramatic sensibility, each projecting a different tone.</quote></p>

<p>She says that in drawing the two Dromios from <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>, Sh. practiced Terentian <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">contaminatio</foreign>, and in addition, he practiced (p. 20) <quote>extracontamination,</quote> adding characters and situations from nondramatic sources (Egeon and the Abbess) and (p. 21) <quote><quote>auto-contamination,</quote> the addition of a character of his own invention,</quote> Luciana.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0006-a"/>
<p>Very occasionally Plautus is preferred. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kenc1753"><name type="app">Lennox</name></ref> (1753, 2:238–9): <quote part="I">The Mistakes which arise from the Resemblance of the Twins, are conducted with much less Art by <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> than <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">In the <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> Poet all appears the Effects of Chance, in <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> of Design; the Persons in his Drama are hardly ever introduced with Propriety; they appear on the Stage, and go off again, evidently for no other Purpose than to give Occasion for the Blunders which ensue.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">239</hi>] Those Errors do not as in the play, which <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> borrowed from [Warner, which she has not seen, nor can she read Latin; she uses a French translation of Plautus], arise out of a natural and probable Succession of Incidents, but every Thing is put out of its course to introduce them, and each Error is produced by an Absurdity.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_conw1924"><name type="app">Connely</name></ref> (1924, pp. 303–4) flatly prefers Plautus to Sh., calling the preference for Sh. <quote>blunders</quote> which depend on <quote>ignorance of Plautus and an apparent belief that Shakspere is omnipotent.</quote> Sh.’s defect is the doubling of the twins. <quote>It is well enough to insist that the more improbabilities the funnier the farce, but is the fun heightened by confusion of the audience? Why make a farce an extravaganza?</quote> Furthermore, Sh. adds six characters to Plautus’s ten, so that (p. 304) <quote>his minor characters have not enough to do to make them either indispensable or adequately amusing. Through the mouth of another character Luce is mildly funny as an amorous greasy Joan; through the mouth of another character Pinch is as graphic as the apothecary in Romeo and Juliet,</quote> and so on through the whole cast, all diluted in Sh., pungent and forceful in Plautus. Sh. was immature and improved immeasurably. Though Connely exaggerates, one might as well admit the justice of many of his points.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wath1925"><name type="app">Watt</name></ref> (1925, pp. 401–2) agrees with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_conw1924"><name type="app">Connely</name></ref>, but objects that invidious comparisons either way are pointless, <quote>for the two plays were written under conditions entirely different and served audiences as remote as the poles.</quote> Connely does not sufficiently respond to the (p. 402) <quote>romantic spirit of Elizabethan comedy and the dramatic form which that spirit assumed. No comparison of the Latin and the Elizabethan play can be sound which is based on the assumption that Shakespeare tried on the whole to copy Plautus, and that he is weakest where he is least skillful as an imitator.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ducg1952"><name type="app">Duckworth</name></ref> (1952, p. 418) admires <title level="m">Err.</title>, but <quote>the presence of two sets of twins&hellip;makes the play more confusing [than <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>] and heightens the improbability of the situation, as was not the case in the <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>, where the two pairs of doublets were created by divine <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">fiat</foreign>. The entrances and exits of Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse at times lack motivation and the conclusion of the comedy is complicated by an excessive number of recognitions. Plautus’ comedy has a unity and a compactness lacking in Shakespeare’s play; it is pure farce, while <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> has far greater variety and is thoroughly Elizabethan in its combination of farce, romance, and pathos.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg1989"><name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (1989, pp. 395 ff.), in a generally iconoclastic study, prefers Latin comedy, especially Plautus; he quotes recent criticism (e.g., <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pel1"><name type="app">Jorgensen</name></ref>, ed. 1964; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bara1974"><name type="app">Barton</name></ref>, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_evns"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref>, ed. 1974; <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ban2"><name type="app">Bevington</name></ref>, ed. 1988), remarking first that everyone takes <title level="m">Err.</title> to be the first comedy, if not the first play, without sufficient evidence: <quote>Recent scholarship would place <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> somewhere toward the end of the first quarter of Shakespeare’s career—not, by a long shot, his earliest play or even his earliest comedy. But most of the critics I am about to quote consider it his first work, and yet they feel no compunction about repeatedly asserting that, in every sort of way, it surpasses a mature work of one of the two acknowledged masters of Roman comedy.</quote></p>

<p>Second, he objects to the notion that Sh. improves on Plautus by cleaning up the immorality. (P. 397): <quote part="I">It is no doubt symptomatic of my own cynicism, amorality, and satirical hardness that this description [<ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ban2"><name type="app">Bevington</name></ref>’s] of the superiority of Shakespeare’s play makes me want to read Plautus. I am reminded of Joe Orton’s wish that he should never write anything <quote>as bad as</quote> Shakespeare’s first plays. Are we to deduce from Bevington that courtesans are less legitimate as the subjects of great art than <quote>virtuous sisters</quote>? Must every comedy <quote>enhance the love interest</quote>? The phrase [<hi rend="italic">398</hi>] could have been excerpted from a movie magnate’s memo to a hack scriptwriter. Is it the business of a great artist to reshape his material in order to <quote>reconcile</quote> it with the moral values of his time and place?&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">400</hi>] <quote part="M">What I personally admire about Plautus&hellip;is what Shakespearians so regularly deprecate: hardness, toughness, exuberant and fantastic amorality. And what I dislike about Shakespeare’s comedies—and tragedies—is their softness, their central mushiness, their inevitable <quote>love interest,</quote> their wholesomeness.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">In order to celebrate the gentle wholesomeness of Shakespeare, critics devalue the hard-core exuberance of Plautus.&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bara1974"><name type="app">Barton</name></ref>].</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">401</hi>] <quote part="M">She diminishes the value of Plautus because he does nothing more than evoke a rather <quote>simple</quote> laughter. Presumably, therefore, great comedy does something more than make us laugh.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Plautine comedy does no more than <quote>turn the normal world upside down</quote> [<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bara1974"><name type="app">Barton</name></ref>]. There is something almost immoral, something psy&shy;[<hi rend="italic">402</hi>]chologically unhealthy, about the whole idea of turning the world upside down.

<p>20 So the worde of God grewe mightely, and preuailed.</p>

<p>21 ¶ Now when these things were accomplished, Paul purposed by the Spirit to passe through Macedonia and Achaia, and to go to Ierusalem, saying, After I haue bene there, I must also se Rome.</p>

<p>22 So sent he into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and Erastus, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> he remained in Asia for a season.</p>

<p>23 And the same time there arose no smale trouble about that way.</p>

<p>24 For a certeine man named Demetrius a siluersmith, which made siluer temples of Diana, broght great gaines vnto the craftes men:</p>

<p>25 Whome he called together, with the workemen of like things, and said, Sirs, ye knowe that by this crafte we haue our goods.</p>

<p>26 Moreouer ye se and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost through out all Asia this Paul hathe persuaded, &amp; turned away muche people, saying, That they be not gods which are made with hands,</p>

<p>27 So that not onely this thing is dangerous vnto vs, that the state shulde be reproued, but also that the temple of the great goddesse Diana shulde be nothing estemed, and that it wolde come to passe that her magnificence, which all Asia and the worlde worshippeth, shulde be destroyed.</p>

<p>28 Now when they heard it, they were ful of wrath, and cryed out, saying, Great <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Diana of the Ephesians.</p>

<p>29 And the whole citie was ful of cõfusion, and they rushed into the commune place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, &amp; Pauls companions of his iourney.</p>

<p>30 And whẽ Paul wolde haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him not.</p>

<p>31 Certeine also of the chief of Asia which were his friẽds, sent vnto him, desirĩg him that he wolde not present him self in the commune place.</p>

<p>32 Some therefore cryed one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of order, and the more parte knewe not wherefore they were come together.</p>

<p>33 And <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of the companie drewe forthe Alexander, the Iewes thrusting him forwardes. Alexander then beckened with the hand, and wolde haue excused the matter to the people.</p>

<p>34 But when they knewe that he was a Iewe, there arose a shoute almoste for the space of two houres, of all men crying, Great <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Diana of the Ephesians.</p>

<p>35 Then the towne clarke when he had stayed the people, said, Ye mẽ of Ephesus, what man is it that knoweth not how that the citie of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddesse Diana, and of <hi rend="italic">the image</hi>, which came downe from Iupiter?</p>

<p>36 Seing then that no man can speake against these things, ye oght to be appeased, and to do nothing rashly.</p>

<p>37 For ye haue broght hither these men, which haue neither commit sacrilege, nether do blaspheme your goddesse.</p>

<p>38 Wherefore, if Demetrius and the craftes men which are with him, haue a matter against any mã, the lawe is open, &amp; there are Deputies: let them accuse one another.</p>

<p>39 But if ye inquire anie thing concerning other matters it maye be determined in a lawful assemblie.</p>

<p>40 For we are euen in ieopardie to be accused of this daies sedicion, forasmuche as there is no cause, whereby we may giue a reason of this concourse of people.</p>

<head>Shakespeare’s Use of the Bible</head>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_uptj1746"><name type="app">Upton</name></ref> (1748, pp. 323–4 n.), commenting on <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0263" targetEnd="#tln_0268">263–8</ref>, first notes <rs type="bibleref">Acts 19</rs> as a reason Sh. chose to set the play in Ephesus. See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0002-01">2</ref>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1957, 1:9–10) first elaborates the influence of Ephesians beyond the mere reputation of Ephesus as a city Paul visits in <rs type="bibleref">Acts 19</rs>: <quote part="I">But why substitute Ephesus [for Epidamnus]?</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">His choice was, I believe, connected with his interest in family relationships, and also with his desire to make <title level="m">The Comedy</title> a play of wonders in which every loose end should finally be tied up. Ephesus was well known to Elizabethans as the capital of Roman Asia, a great seaport, renowned for its Temple of Diana and as the place where St Paul stayed two years (<rs type="bibleref">Acts xix</rs>). The <title level="m">Epistle to the Ephesians</title> includes earnest exhortations to domestic unity. [He quotes <rs type="bibleref" key="Eph.">5:22–33</rs>.] [<hi rend="italic">10</hi>] The Apostle also writes of relations between children and parents, and urges servants <quote>to be obedient unto them that are your masters,</quote> while masters are to forbear threatening their servants (<rs type="bibleref" key="Eph.">VI.1–9</rs>). Is it fanciful to suggest that Shakespeare saw the aptness of this as he christianized somewhat the ethics of Plautus’s comedy? Does the Ephesian locale explain why the Mother becomes an Abbess, in reminiscence of the Temple of Diana with its priestesses?</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">In addition, Ephesus was a place of sorcerers and exorcists, and <quote>curious arts</quote> as St Paul states. Of this idea Shakespeare makes good use.</quote> See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0002-01">2</ref>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, p. xxix) acknowledges <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref>’s citations, and adds <rs type="bibleref">Eph. 4:22–4</rs>, and <rs type="bibleref" key="Eph.">6:11–17</rs> in his Appendix 1, pp. 113–15, collating Geneva and Bishops’.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_parp1983a"><name type="app">Parker</name></ref> (<title level="a">Anagogic Metaphor,</title> 1983, pp. 38–9) writes about anagogic metaphor and breaking down the wall of partition. [It is perhaps useless to object that what separates the twins in Act 3 is a door, not a wall, a fact that might hinder an audience’s getting an allusion to Eph.] She cites <rs type="bibleref">Eph. 2:14–15 (Authorized Version)</rs>: <quote>For he [Christ] is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us [Jew and Gentile]&hellip;for to make in himself of twain one new man.</quote> She explains: <quote><quote>Breaking down the wall of partition</quote>&hellip;joins the rending of the veil of the temple as a radical crossing or abolition of boundaries; and both link the Crucifixion to the anagogy it figures, the final apocalyptic [<hi rend="italic">39</hi>] removal of partition walls.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0041"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_parp1987"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1987, pp. 17 ff.) expands <title level="a">Anagogic Metaphor,</title> 1983, adding how the rhetorical figure <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">geminatio</foreign>, the doublet, pervades the language, structure, and plot of the play, dramatizing the biblical narrative of the twins Jacob and Esau.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kina1988"><name type="app">Kinney</name></ref> (1988, pp. 36–8, 48, 50): <quote part="I">Here [Eph.] we find in the Christian New Testament, rather than in Roman farce, the source that inspired <hi rend="italic">all</hi> parts of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>—that gives it its overall shape and significance, not only mixing with but embodying and transforming Plautine conventions. This summary comes not in the sermon on order and on the directions for husbands and wives, parents and children that has often been cited from <rs type="bibleref" key="Eph.">Ephesians 6</rs>,&hellip;but in the summary of life’s experiences in <rs type="bibleref" key="Eph.">Ephesians 2</rs> (a text as popular with the Tudors as the later passage). This is a source which has never been cited in connection with <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, but which proceeds from a statement on death not unlike Egeon’s through the sin and confusion of the play’s chief action and finally to the last transformation of spirit before the priory. <quote>And you <hi rend="italic">hathe he quickened</hi>,</quote> Paul writes [<rs type="bibleref">Eph. 2:2–10</rs>]. [<hi rend="italic">37</hi>] <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the Ephesus the Elizabethans knew by trained instinct, not Shakespeare’s. The enforced segregation of Syracusan and Ephesian in the play—like the separation of Jews from Gentiles and Christians from Pharisees in the Bible—results from human sin and hostility which focus on the wrong kind of transgression of the wrong kind of laws. The Elizabethans knew and understood that from childhood. Such divisive acts of fallen man, spurred on by evil lust and Satanic intention in Shakespeare’s play, were just those acts that God, Jesus, and Paul meant to heal by <hi rend="italic">reunion</hi>. Thus the central theme of the letter to the Ephesians, and one which Elizabethan preachers proclaimed with cogency and simplicity, is not only that of order but that of a reuniting—we think of the speeches on reunion as a kind of transformation back into the original state in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> [fn. to <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199">199</ref> ff., <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0590" targetEnd="#tln_0591">590–1</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1125" targetEnd="#tln_1128">1125–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1133" targetEnd="#tln_1134">1133–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1747" targetEnd="#tln_1749">1747–9</ref>]—and the same theme emphasized in the only drama written with Paul as its hero, the non-cycle Digby play known as <title level="m">The Conversion of St. Paul</title>.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Sensing this deeper organization in a play more integral and traditional than it is to us, the Tudors would see the end of <title level="m">The Comedy of [<hi rend="italic">38</hi>] Errors</title>, centered as it is on the Abbess, as natural and fitting.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">By changing the classical Epidamnum&hellip;to the Christian Ephesus associated with Paul&hellip;Shakespeare decisively if subtly shifts the generic expectations of an Elizabethan audience steeped in Scripture and the liturgical calendar from pure farce to something like a divine comedy in which emotional experiences and intellectual reflections portrayed by the characters are shared simultaneously by the playgoers despite their privileged knowledge of the twinned Antipholi and their twinned Dromios.</quote></p>

<p>He finds the mixture of farce and serious Christian spirituality of the morality plays influential on <title level="m">Err.</title>, as well as such thematic phrasing as (p. 48) the <quote>strikingly appositive</quote> last petition of the litany in the Book of Common Prayer, <quote>Thoughe we be tyed and bounde with the chayne of our synnes, yet let the pitifulness of thy great mercy lose vs,</quote> and, from the General Confession at Morning Prayer, <quote>We ha[u]e erred and straied from thy waies, lyke lost shepe.</quote></p>

<p>(P. 50): <quote>The wonders of the religious drama highlight the piling on of wonders that is the concluding movement of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, yet none is more wonderful than this: that so short a play—actually Shakespeare’s briefest—moves all the way from the Nativity to the Last Judgment, spanning not only the life of the Christian but all Christian history as well. That too is the essential idea behind Paul’s letter to the Ephesians and so may also lie behind Shakespeare’s choice of scene.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hunm1997"><name type="app">Hunt</name></ref> (1997, pp. 31 ff.) enlarges the notion of slavery, arising out of the uniquely large number of beatings the Dromios suffer, to include de facto slavery: <quote>The playwright’s focus on de facto slavery widens to encompass the institution of marriage and the individual’s ordering of his or her inner faculties. Implicitly Shakespeare poses a dramatic question: do the reunions and festive releases celebrated at the end of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> include a remedy for slavery, whether of the social, marital, or existential variety?</quote> He canvasses <title level="m">Err.</title> criticism to show how the beatings are generally explained away, usually because farce invites violence, but he disagrees that the beatings are unimportant. The answer to his question above is that the play does provide a remedy, one based on Eph., characterized (p. 54) as Paul’s <quote>radical anti-enslavement message.&hellip;For informed playgoers, pertinent passages in Ephesians operate as a subtext in Shakespeare’s play, providing a corrective for the enslavement of servants, spouses, and parts of the self even when dramatic characters do not expressly voice and act out the texts.</quote></p>

<p>Other commentators do not focus on specific books and epistles:</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_birw1848"><name type="app">Birch</name></ref> (1848, pp. 121 ff.) is scandalized by Sh.’s impiety: <quote>This play was made&hellip;to be more Christian than Pagan, in order to be at ease in comedy, and witty at the expense of Christianity, which was better for that purpose than Paganism.</quote> Of 1231–50 (p. 123): <quote>Here is a famous quotation from scripture, introduced to make low jokes on the worst subjects. Do such associations bespeak a reverential mind?</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_welj1975"><name type="app">Weld</name></ref> (1975, pp. 156–7, 167–8): <quote part="I">This play&hellip;asks us to see a human being threatened with the legal judgment of death, and the total concept of human nature implied by the play must somehow include this view too.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">157</hi>] <quote part="M">He [Aegeon, 38] stands condemned <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">qua</foreign> human being, for original sin, for nature, not vile offense.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Clearly the relevant concept of human nature is the one Lyly had exploited, the one common at the time, taught in catechism, sermon, and treatise, which saw man as condemned by justice for his corrupt and fallen nature to a death from which only a ransom he could not meet could save him. It saw him also as doomed by that nature to err, and comic in that error.</quote></p>

<p>After rehearsing the comic errors, he comes to Act 5, Aemilia’s entrance with the twins that clears matters up. (P. 167): <quote part="I">Now these events are presented on the stage as parts of one action. They occur simultaneously; they are immediate and visible results of Aemilia’s entrance, and they are themselves closely related.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The theatrical identity is also thematic. Most obviously the events constitute a happy ending.&hellip;Clarity has succeeded error; harmony, discord; and mercy has tempered justice. By the law Aegeon is still con&shy;[<hi rend="italic">168</hi>]demned [but the Duke pardons him]. This is&hellip;fantasy, at least in effect. The legal point is avoided. The one point relevant is made: Aegeon is set free. Man will not die for his nature. Charity has replaced justice. The Old Law is dead.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The events&hellip;reflect three aspects of the central fact of man’s redemption, which, within the Christian frame of things, is what makes comedy with a happy ending possible. The ending is still within the human situation, however.&hellip;Confusion has not quite ended. The chance for error still remains.&hellip;This sort of mistaking [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1848" targetEnd="#tln_1860">1848–60</ref>] is no longer dangerous, but it is there, and it is comic. Human beings may be saved from the tragic consequences of their nature, but they remain human and fallible and funny.</quote></p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0032-a"/>
<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_parp1996"><name type="app">Parker</name></ref> (1996, pp. 56 ff.): The <quote>master narrative</quote> of Jacob and Esau influences the play; she repeats much of her earlier essays’ use of Ephesians and the Apocalypse. (P. 64): <quote>Echoes of Jacob and Esau&hellip;hover around the edges of this discussion of whether something lost—an heir as well as hair—can ever be recovered. <quote>There’s many a man hath more hair than wit</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0476" targetEnd="#tln_0477">476–7</ref>]&hellip;could be said&hellip;of Esau, the <quote>hairy</quote> man who, outwitted by his usurping twin, loses his right as the elder son or heir. The Genesis story of a father with two twin sons&hellip;could yield the mock-learned conclusion here (<quote>thou didst conclude hairy men to be plain dealers without wit</quote>) [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0480" targetEnd="#tln_0481">480–1</ref>]. Jacob,</quote> often called bald in contrast to hairy Esau, <quote part="I">becomes the rightful heir by covering himself with the <quote>lost hair</quote> of another man. For this Esau there might indeed be said to be <quote>no time to recover</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0466">466</ref>] (in <rs type="bibleref">Heb. 12:17</rs>, deprived of his <quote>blessing,</quote> he finds <quote>no place to repentance,</quote> as the Geneva Bible puts it). No time for recovery in this sense would suggest the absence of the space and time for repentance and redemption, which is the principal reason for the interim of delay and reprieve before what this exchange invokes, once again, as the world’s end, or Doom.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">81</hi>] <quote part="F">The sheer number of its biblical and morality play allusions has led some critics to assumptions that are [<hi rend="italic">82</hi>] strenuously theological, however discordant this emphasis might be with other elements within the play. But the summoning of the teleological master narrative of the Bible in Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Comedy</title> is finally something less theological than it is&hellip;a source of metaphors for dramatic structure, detached from belief or homiletic piety. What we have in Shakespeare’s plays—even in such a self-consciously and densely biblical one as this early comedy—is something closer to what C. L. Barber termed <quote>post-Christian.</quote> The critic of Shakespeare&hellip;must be prepared&hellip;both to recognize the identifications forged by such allusive networks—beyond the apparently marginal importance of the isolated verbal quibble—and to consider what is being done <hi rend="italic">to</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">through</hi> such authoritative structures.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hasr1979"><name type="app">Hassel</name></ref> (1979, pp. 39 ff.) proposes, as part of a larger study on the ways plays were chosen to accord with themes of the church year as laid out in the Book of Common Prayer, that <title level="m">Err.</title> is appropriate to Holy Innocents’ Day, 28 Dec., the feast commemorating Herod’s slaughter of the children aged two years and under in Jerusalem and its environs. <title level="m">Err.</title> was played on that feast in 1594 (Gray’s Inn) and in 1604 at court: <quote>Error seems to have been the traditional hallmark of Innocents’ celebrations.&hellip;The reason&hellip;is the centuries-old tradition of beginning the Feast of Fools on Childermas or Innocents’ Day. Until the time of the <title level="m">Spectator</title>, Innocents was considered for this reason <quote>the most unlucky day in the calendar,</quote> it certainly is so to the inhabitants of Ephesus.

<p>(P. 40): <quote part="I">A glance at the liturgical tradition of Innocents’ Day makes it even less likely that mere nostalgia or coincidence explains the dual performance of the play on that religious festival. The repetition of <hi rend="italic">nativitie</hi> in the final lines&hellip;seems to suggest a general awareness of the Christmas season. More specifically, as soon as we read the <quote>proper</quote> Lesson [scripture reading appointed for the day] prescribed for Holy Innocents’ Day in the <title level="m">Book of Common Prayer</title>, we are struck by relationships to the framing story of Egeon and Emilia, Shakespeare’s unique addition to his sources. <rs type="bibleref">Jer. 31:1–17</rs> [the Old Testament proper], like the framework of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, is about [<hi rend="italic">41</hi>] the dispersal and reunion of families. In fact, from such other prescribed passages as <rs type="bibleref">Bar. 4:21–30</rs>, <rs type="bibleref">Matt. 2:13–18</rs>, <rs type="bibleref">Rev. 14:1–5</rs>, and <rs type="bibleref">Isa. 60</rs>, we realize that this theme was a central motif of the liturgical festival.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Dealing as it does with the Lord’s promise to reunite the dispersed and weeping families of Israel, <rs type="bibleref" key="Jer.">Jeremiah 31</rs> is insistently parallel to the first and final scenes of <title level="m">Errors</title>. After the Lord’s several promises to gather the remnant of Israel from the coasts of the world, verses <rs type="bibleref" key="Jer.">15–17</rs>, on the ultimate deliverance of all innocents, seem particularly close to the situation and the sensibility of Egeon and Emilia, parents of their own lost children:

<quote rend="block"><p>15 A voice was heard on hie, a mourning and bitter weping, Ra&lt;c&gt;hel weping for her children,&hellip;because thei were not.</p>
<p>16 Thus saith the Lord, Refraine thy voice from weping, and thine eyes from teares: for thy worke shalbe rewarded, saith ye Lord, and thei shal come againe from the land of the enemie.</p>
<p>17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shal come againe to their owne borders.</p></quote>

In the other prescribed passages the theme remains the same: innocents have been scattered or displaced by their enemies, but they will eventually be returned home, even if that home is with the Lamb in heaven [<rs type="bibleref">Rev. 14</rs>].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">42</hi>] <quote part="F">That the lords of Gray’s Inn had just been absolved of their own guilt by the prince of Purpoole, thus becoming themselves mock-innocents and fools, may have heightened both the absurd and the serious dimensions of the parallel. They could hardly have hoped to see a more pertinent entertainment on the night of 28 December.</quote> [It may be objected, however, that Psalm 79 and the Collect emphasize death and penitence, e.g., <quote><hi rend="lscaps">Almighty</hi> God, whose prayse this daye the yong innocentes thy witnesses hath confessed and shewed forth, not in speaking but in dying; Mortifye and kyll all vyces in us</quote> from the Collect. Such a tone would not befit a revels.]</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hent1986"><name type="app">Hennings</name></ref> (1986, pp. 96 ff.), on the debate between Adriana and Luciana in 2.1: <quote part="I">The general tenor of Luciana’s remarks is inconsistent with the description of a happily married couple found in the current marriage literature, especially with that of the&hellip;<title level="a">Homilie of the state of Matrimonie.</title>&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">It challenges the older Catholic claim that procreation is the primary purpose of marriage with the Protestant view of its true and original purpose: <quote>It is instituted of GOD&hellip;that man and woman should liue lawfully in a perpetuall friendship</quote> ([<title level="m">Certaine Sermons</title>, 1968,] p. 239).&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">97</hi>] Explicitly contradicting Luciana’s defense of the double standard, the homily defines the grand folly of human nature: <quote>For this folly is euer from our tender age growne [v]p with us, to haue a desire to rule, to thinke highly of our selfe, so that none thinketh it meet to giue place to another. That wicked vice of stubborne will and selfe loue, is more meet to breake and to disseuer the loue of heart, then to preserue concorde</quote> (p. 240).</quote></p>
<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0008-b"/>
  
<p>Paraphrasing the homily, he continues: <quote part="I">Husbands must strive to be of one will with their wives [<rs type="bibleref">Eph. 5:21–33</rs>], and therefore they must become humble. They must be understanding, attentive, and compassionate, and they must instruct by edifying example. To be sure, wives too must be meek and humble, and they must willingly obey their husbands as Sarah did Abraham—yet the exemplary pattern of a husband is not Abraham. In one of the most remarkable instances of the influence of Renaissance humanism on Christian thought, the official Anglican sermon declares that the ideal husband&hellip;is the pagan <quote>Socrates,</quote> who meekly endured the <quote>euill manners</quote> of his shrewish wife so that he might <quote>bee the more quiet with others, being thus dayly exercised and taught in the forbearing of her</quote> (p. 247).</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">It is precisely because the sermon wants to change the older thinking about marital roles that it instructs the husband in meekness and patience and humility. An indifferent, uncaring, or domi&shy;[<hi rend="italic">98</hi>]neering husband is not a good Christian.</quote> So, he concludes, those who take Luciana to be the play’s authority on marriage are wrong.

<head>Gower, <title level="a">Apollonius of Tyre</title></head>

<p>Sh. knew this romance from John Gower, in Bk. 8, <title level="m">Confessio Amantis</title>, printed in 1483, 1532, and 1554; from Laurence Twine’s prose version, <title level="m">The Patterne of Painefull Aduentures</title> (STC 709, revised <title level="m">STC</title> 709 and 709.5, entered in S.R. 1576); or from both. Sh. apparently used Gower (1554) for <title level="m">Per.</title>, as well as Twine’s <title level="m">Patterne</title>, perhaps in an ed. of 1607. The <title level="m">STC</title> entry is <quote>1594?</quote>. That uncertainty is removed in the revised <title level="m">STC</title>. If Sh. used Twine, it would settle the date of composition, but the evidence is inconclusive. In Twine, but not in Gower, Apollonius’s wife is named Lucina, leading <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1957, 1:50) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, p. xxxi) to mistakenly give her the name in Gower where in fact she is nameless. There is no other evidence that Sh. used Twine for <title level="m">Err.</title> <hi rend="italic">Lucina</hi> looks promising as a hint for Luciana, but the contrasting Adriana-Luciana (see <ptr targType="note_cn" target="#dpcn_15"/>) probably better accounts for the name.</p>

<p>The following extracts, slightly different from <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref>’s, are from ed. 1554 (<title level="m">STC</title> 12144), a quarto in black letter; I have used a microfilm of that quarto.

<head>Other Sources and Influences</head>

<p>The extent to which Italian drama influenced Sh. is not fully known or agreed on. What follows are the strongest arguments for that influence through either the scripted comedies, called <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia erudita</foreign> early in the 16th c. and, with slight changes, <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia grave</foreign> later, or the <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell’arte</foreign> or improvised theater, based on stock scenarios acted by professional players. The proponents say that Sh. could have found all the non-Plautine elements he either invents or imports from romance sources in this Italian theater.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sarg1897"><name type="app">Sarrazin</name></ref> (1897, p. 105) suggests that several Italian plays have similar contents without necessarily being sources: Trissino’s <title level="m">Simillimi</title>, Cecchi’s <title level="m">Le Moglie</title>, and Agnolo Firenzuola’s <title level="m">I Lucidi</title>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_leak1934"><name type="app">Lea</name></ref> (1934, 2:434 ff.) gets around any influence on Sh. himself by accepting <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>’s (ed. 1922) hypothesis that Sh. revised an old play which, she says, first embodied the <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell’arte</foreign> aspects she details: <quote part="I">Certain resemblances to the Commedia dell’arte may be accounted for as direct borrowings taking place most probably at a pre-Shakespearian stage of development. No single scenario has come to light which could be regarded as a source for either of these plays [<title level="m">Tmp.</title> and <title level="m">Err.</title>], but the more we know of the nature of the Commedia dell’arte the less we expect the evidence of contact between the two dramas to take this form: the scenari should not be studied singly but as they group themselves into the stage traditions of the farces of mistaken identity and the comic pastorals or shipwreck plays.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The coincidence of the action of the <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> with all the chief features of the plays of mistaken doubles in the Commedia dell’arte is almost complete, but something must [<hi rend="italic">435</hi>] be allowed for a common inheritance from&hellip;Plautus.&hellip;[But t]he scene in which the courtesan lures Antipholus of Syracuse in spite of Dromio’s warning [?4.3; Antipholus resists her from her entrance], Pinch’s dealings with the madman, Dromio of Ephesus announcing his freedom [she is thinking of Messenio; Dromio has no such speech], are nearer to the Latin than to any modifications which survive in Italian.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">But when we come to consider the amplifications of the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> theme it is obvious that while the classical comedy was Shakespeare’s ultimate it was not his immediate model. These amplifications fall into three groups: the framework concerning the Duke, Aegeon, and the Abbess; the introduction of Luciana as a confidante for Adriana and a wife for Antipholus of Syracuse; and the addition of twin slaves which brings about the extra complications of the cooling dinner, the lost purse, and the disputes over the rope-end and the unpaid-for chain.</quote></p>

<p>She spends several pages hypothesizing three stages of the play, Sh.’s being the third. (P. 438): <quote part="I">Whoever was elaborating the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> theme in order to produce a farce for the English players seems to have been acquainted with the ways in which the comedy of mistaken identity was exploited on the Italian stage. The details of the variations played upon the confusion of twin lovers, masters, fathers, and servants may be studied in detail in the representative scenari printed in the Appendix [not reprinted here].&hellip;To have seen the see-saw action of a <quote>doubles</quote> play with its denials, beatings, jeerings, defiances, jealousies, and apologies and to have caught up the mere suggestion of doubling those doubles would be enough for this diviner of the springs of laughter.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">By status the Dromios of Shakespeare’s play are the slaves of Latin comedy, but in behaviour and misfortunes they are the servants of the Commedia dell’arte. They are beaten as regularly as any Zanni and for the same reasons. The excuses that provoke misunderstandings are ordinary enough, the misdelivery of any message or trinket will serve. In <title level="m">Li sei Simili</title> it is actually a ring and a chain that are mislaid.</quote></p>

<p>She summarizes a scenario that bears close resemblances to <title level="m">Err.</title>, but concludes that Sh. refined the sentiments of both Plautus and any scenario he (or the fashioners of the play which preceded his version) might have seen (p. 442): <quote>The sympathetic treatment of the women gives some support to the theory that as Shakespeare revised he refined. Plautus made Menaechmus’ wife a mere scold; Flavia in Locatelli’s version is almost equally wronged by Silvio and she rebounds; but Adriana yields and seeks to know her fault. In the Commedia dell’arte the neglected lady who suspects that her husband has found some fresh attraction, flames up with jealous anger,</quote> but Adriana is more grieved than angry.</p>

<p>Sh.’s additions of pathos and gravity lead us to <quote>suspect that already he was working away from the farcical Italian material with which the <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> at some stage of development had come into contact.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_leak1934"><name type="app">Lea</name></ref>’s account absolves Sh. of coarseness but encourages studying a more nearly contemporary handling of Plautine material than <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gile1930"><name type="app">Gill</name></ref> (1930), with her closely observed analysis of the Latin, could suggest.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bonr1938"><name type="app">Bond</name></ref> (1938, p. 50) proposes Giovammaria Cecchi’s <title level="m">L’ammalata</title> (<title level="m">The Invalid</title>, 1555) as the source for at least that part of <title level="m">Err.</title> involving Aemilia’s status as abbess and healer, located in a story that has other general similarities with <title level="m">Err.</title>, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_leak1934"><name type="app">Lea</name></ref> shows to be utterly common in Italian 16th-c. imitations of Plautus. He grants that the parallels are insignificant, <quote>but may well be worth mention as between plays of different nationality perhaps forty years apart. The clinching point is that in both <title level="m">L’Ammalata</title> and the <title level="m">Errors</title> the long-lost wife or mother is a nun in a monastery, famous for her medical skill, the exercise of which precipitates the dénouement.</quote> As Lea says, there is no good reason to expect to find a certain particular Italian source for <title level="m">Err.</title></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clul1968"><name type="app">Clubb</name></ref> (1968, pp. 240 ff.) summarizes Italian theatrical visits to England in the latter half of the 16th c.: <quote>There are only a few proved connections to support Stephen Gosson’s famous complaint that Italian comedies were <quote>ransackt to furnish the Playe houses in London.</quote></quote></p>

<p>She lists plays translated or adapted in England, cites Queen Elizabeth’s interest in <quote>Comedia Italiana,</quote> records the seven visits of Italian players between 1546 and 1578, and concludes that (p. 241) <quote part="I">by 1591 the traffic seems to have been brisk enough to make disguise as Italian entertainers desirable to foreign spies.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">242</hi>] <quote part="F">Certain features [of <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia erudita</foreign>] became commonplaces&hellip;: the cast of middle-class families and their servants, pedants, soldiers, innkeepers, friars, and courtesans, joined in a series of encounters on the street, in doorways, and at windows; the combination of spatially and temporally restricted farcical intrigue with a potentially romantic antecedent history; the pattern of misunderstanding, disguise, and mistaken identity, kept moving and finally solved by peripeties and recognitions. While the playwrights customarily boasted in their prologues of debts to Plautus, Terence, and Boccaccio, the pieces they borrowed were reassembled to create a total different from the sum of its parts. In the process, they systematically outcomplicated the ancients and strained to do as much to one another.</quote></p>

<p>She describes the improvements in the moral tone of the <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia grave</foreign>, one being an increase in emotional tension (p. 245): <quote>Whatever the proportions, there was always a mixture of sentiment, pathos, and danger with lively comic action. The romantic potential in clichés of&hellip;trade wars, shipwreck, and kidnapping, causing separation of families&hellip;was now developed explicitly.</quote></p>

<p>The courtesan often (p. 246) <quote>becomes a strikingly more sympathetic figure.</quote></p>

<p>The plots grow increasingly complicated. (P. 247): <quote part="I">More original than the doubling and recomplicating&hellip;was the use&hellip;of central themes and motifs.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">248</hi>] <quote part="M">The motif of supposed magic, specifically sorcery, alchemy, and astrology&hellip;in <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia grave</foreign> is tied more closely than before to the language, as well as to whatever happens to be the theme for the variations.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The theme of sorcery was frequently used in conjunction with or as a variation on the theme of madness.</quote></p>

<p>Concluding, she says that the time for looking for specific, immediate sources for Sh. is past (p. 251): <quote>There are many Italian regular comedies based on <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>, but there is no reason to suppose that Shakespeare used any of them or to doubt that his sources were Plautus, Gower, and St. Paul. His choice of elements and his way of blending them, however, give pause.</quote> She lists the plot elements that find their counterparts in Italian comedy. <quote part="I">The combination of these elements, characteristic of <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia grave</foreign>, could not have been suggested by Lyly or Gascoigne, for both <title level="m">Mother Bombie</title> and <title level="m">Supposes</title> belong to the earlier type of regular comedy.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">It cannot be proved that Shakespeare read Italian plays, or saw <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell’arte</foreign> troupes or Italian amateurs at Elizabeth’s court perform <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedie gravi</foreign>, or heard about them from a friend. Nor can <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> be labelled <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia grave</foreign>, for Shakespeare’s most Italianate play is still not an Italian one. It is next to certain, however, that the brilliant young upstart crow knew something about the latest Continental fashion in comedy.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clul1980"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1980, pp. 130 ff.) proposes that <title level="m">Err.</title> is part of a Continental experiment in expanding the limits of theater by writing mixed genre plays: <quote part="I">In the early sixteenth century, when humanistically educated men of letters were producing experimental solutions to the problem of defining the classical genres of comedy and tragedy for vernacular culture, the <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia erudita</foreign> frequently depended on the principle of <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">contaminatio</foreign>, of merging two plots, as Terence had defended doing in [the prologue to] <title level="m">Andria</title>.&hellip;The practice of conflating individual units of action, character, and language from different sources had, even in the early <hi rend="italic">commedie</hi>, sanctioned fusions of Roman comedy with pieces of the <title level="m">Decameron</title> and Petrarchan imagery.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The purpose of the calculated contaminations was to test the nascent rules of dramatic art and the possibility of inventing a third regular genre.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0038">She says that it is no longer possible to say that there (p. 131) <quote part="I">was no important connection between Shakespeare and Italian drama.&hellip;This is a notion that time has hallowed but must now pass by.

<p>[<hi rend="italic">135</hi>] <quote part="M">What needs to be emphasized is not that Shakespeare improves upon his materials—no surprises there—but that he does so as if participating in the quest for mixed genres, aware of Continental theatrical trends while taking advantage of his English license to infringe neoclassical rules and to assay bolder variations and mixtures.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">137</hi>] <quote part="F">In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> the materials he quarried from two Plautine comedies and from a number of other nondramatic sources are mixed and developed by the Italianate technique of multiple <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">contaminatio</foreign>, to bring comedy near to tragedy without transgressing the neoclassical ground rules, to achieve the fullest measure of complexity in pattern and to fit the whole as a metaphor for the appearance/reality relation of fortune/providence.</quote> She catalogs the elements that produce the mixture. Sh. was not adapting a specific Italian play but engaging in a Continental approach to comedy.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rebp1943"><name type="app">Rébora</name></ref> (1925, p. 239; and 1943, pp. 147–8), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_meln1980"><name type="app">Mellamphy</name></ref> (1980) also argue for the influence of commedia on Sh. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_orrd1970"><name type="app">Orr</name></ref> (1970, pp. 40–1) denies the influence.</p>

<p>One strain of supposed influence on <title level="m">Err.</title>, especially in accounting for the non-Plautine aspects, is from medieval drama and romance. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1922, on <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1142">1142</ref>): <quote>It is important to notice that S.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cogn1950"><name type="app">Coghill</name></ref> (1950, pp. 2 ff.) provides a thumbnail history of critical theory describing comedy, from the <quote>Latin grammarians of the fourth century A.D., namely Evanthius, Diomedes and Donatus,</quote> through Vincent of Beauvais (ca. 1250) (p. 4): <quote part="I"><quote>Comedy is a poem changing a sad beginning into a happy ending,</quote>&hellip;a tale of trouble that turned to joy.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">This simple formula is the true basis of Shakespearian Comedy.</quote></p>

<p>This he calls the Romantic view, contrasted to the Satiric view. (P. 7): <quote>The Renaissance view of Comedy was entirely different [from the medieval view]. Its only concern is ridicule.</quote> He cites Whetstone, introduction to <title level="m">Promos and Cassandra</title>; Sidney; Puttenham; and <title level="m">Arte of Rhetoricke</title>, chap 14.</p>

<p>The reason why Renaissance theory and practice emphasized correction is that (p. 9) <quote>the older tradition was for Romance, the new world was all for Punishment. For the new world had to face the onslaught of Puritanism. If the right of poetry to exist at all was to be successfully defended, ethical weapons had to be used.&hellip;Faced by a choice in such matters, a writer is wise if he follows his temperament. Ben Jonson knotted his cat-o’-nine tails. Shakespeare reached for his Chaucer.</quote></p>

<p>Though Sh. starts out with Plautus, <quote>anyone caring for poetical forms&hellip;will find significant differences in the shapes of the two plays [<title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and <title level="m">Err.</title>]. It is not simply a matter of the doubling of the pairs of twins by the exuberant Elizabethan. It is a matter of a change of <hi rend="italic">venue</hi>, of quality, and of catastrophe. He <hi rend="italic">medievalized</hi> the story; he invented a beginning and an end for it, starting in trouble and ending in joy.</quote></p>

<p>He describes the Egeon-Aemilia story, the deferral of death, and the <quote part="I">means of his deliverance.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">These modifications in Plautine structure can hardly have come about by accident or whim. And if by whim, how is it that the new shape should correspond so exactly with the medieval view of what is proper to comic form?</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">This new shape brings with it an incidental feature in play-construction, in the conventions rather than in the form of English Comedy. It [<hi rend="italic">10</hi>] fills the stage with the whole happy cast at the catastrophe. In the <title level="m">Menoechmi</title> [sic] the play closes with the twins and their servant [sic] only on stage. Shakespearian and almost all subsequent comic drama in England closes with a stage cram full of happy people; the whole world of the play has been led into delight, and with it the whole audience.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The changes in venue and structure go with a change in quality. It is not simply that there is a general coarseness and selfishness in Plautus’s personal relations that is not to be found in Shakespeare. There is a specific and medieval delicacy injected&hellip;by the invention of a romantic sub-plot—the love-affair between Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana. Save for the greater lyrical fluency of Shakespeare it is Chaucerian, and its sentiments are those of <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">amour courtois</foreign>: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0821" targetEnd="#tln_0827">821–7</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Love as the centre and solvent of all troubles could not absolutely govern this Comedy of mistaken identity, but it thrust its way into it and coloured the conclusion.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chah1931"><name type="app">Charlton</name></ref> (1931; 1938, p. 70): <quote>Between Plautus and Luciana are the centuries in which chivalry and its achievements in life and letters had evolved the love which, like God, makes earth and man anew. The world which is enshrined in mediæval romance was embedded in the inherited experience of the sixteenth century. Even when he was recoiling from romanticism, Shakespeare could not divest himself of the romantic. And so these alien elements are stuffed within his imitation of a classical play.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_math1962"><name type="app">Matthews</name></ref> (1962, p. 84), without elaborating: <quote>Men had not forgotten the dichotomy of Justice and Mercy central in the miracle plays, but in sixteenth century drama it lay dormant until Shakespeare, with some apparent incongruity, brought it life once more in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sall1974"><name type="app">Salingar</name></ref> (1974, pp. 26, 59, 65–6): <quote>In broad terms, the romantic elements in his plays spring from the Middle Ages, while his sense of comic irony stems from the Roman playwrights and his feeling for comedy as festivity expresses the culture of the renaissance. It was a decisive mark of his genius as a playwright that he could bring into unity this diversity of traditions.</quote></p>

<p>(P. 59) Writing about <title level="a">Egeon and Apollonius,</title> he thinks that Sh.’s acquaintance with Greek romances from such collections as the <title level="m">Golden Legend</title> was wide and influenced him.</p>

<p>(P. 65): <quote>As stories involving the extraordinary reunion of twin brothers, both the Clement and Eustace legend are related to Plautus’s <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>&hellip;; and it seems likely that Shakespeare remembered both legends when constructing his own play. The way Egeon’s family has been separated—the rock splitting their mast after the shipwreck, the two ships each rescuing one of the parents and one of the children, but unable to join, and then the grown son leaving his father to find his brother&hellip;—recalls the father’s tantalizing, successive losses in the Placidas [i.e., Saint Eustace] story; while Shakespeare’s dénouement—the prepared execution transformed into a scene of rejoicing—could have been suggested to him by the similar ending devised by Barnabe Riche. And the dénouement&hellip;also borrows from the Clement legend (as well as from <title level="m">Apollonius</title>, which Shakespeare is following to the extent of locating his play at Ephesus and making the mother an <quote>Abbess</quote> there). In the Clement legend, Peter’s enemy, Simon Magus (<quote>Simon the enchanter</quote>), wishing to escape from execution as a magician, casts his own appearance on Clement’s father—in Caxton’s translation, <quote>he imprinted his similitude and likeness in this old man Faustinian, in such wise that of every man he was supposed to be Simon Magus</quote>; with the result that, although the sons recognise their father’s <quote>voice,</quote> they would run away from him but for St Peter’s intervention. Egeon meets with a similar [<hi rend="italic">66</hi>] incomprehension from Antipholus of Ephesus, just before the other twin comes back on the stage: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1775" targetEnd="#tln_1791">1775–91</ref>]. There is nothing like this in the Apollonius story; but transformation by strange means, the proximity of an enchanter or <quote>conjurer</quote>&hellip;, the quasi-biblical setting and the danger of an execution are details all common here to the play and the saint’s legend. Here, then, where Shakespeare is bringing to a climax the tale of Egeon as a man tried by fate or Providence over a period of many years, it is clear that he is not following one narrative source alone but fusing scattered incidents together from a broad tradition of exemplary romance.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_haro1980"><name type="app">Hardison</name></ref> (1980, pp. 316–18): <quote part="I">As soon as one moves beyond these obviously classical features [<quote>The play is set in Ephesus, a suitable classical location, and its characters appear to be taken from the Sears catalogue of ancient comic types: the tricky servant, the lively courtesan, the indignant husband, the shrewish wife</quote>], however, the image changes.

<p>(P. 318): <quote part="I">Then there is the cook [Luce]. Nothing quite like the cook exists in classical drama. The whole play stops for the cook, who is drawn from the same current of medieval realism that produced the works of Rabelais and Grobius.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>At first it is hard to see any connections between the play and the medieval drama. (P. 40): <quote>But in this instance&hellip;our conventional expectations betray us.

<p>He marshals scholarship that shows Sh. adapting the medieval drama in tragedies and history plays. (P. 42): <quote>The form and features of the mystery cycles are pervasive in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>. The cycles began with serious treatments of the fall (and <quote>death</quote>) of Adam (needing, like Egeon, to be saved in the person or representative of Christ), moved into knockabout farce with plays on Cain and Abel (much as we witness with the treatment of the two Dromios), and then restored high seriousness in showing how Christ’s love conquered travail and sin (as with the increasing seriousness of the final scenes of Shakespeare’s play).</quote> Even the staging of some cycle plays, where neutral playing places served for simultaneous staging and <quote>took on moral signification,</quote> makes <title level="m">Err.</title> familiar. (P. 43): <quote>Following these plays, <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> depicts a representative mankind falling into confusion; distracted by worldly things (like a cloak and a chain [he is confusing <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> here]) of a mercantile world, such as the merchants of Ephesus whom St. Paul addresses; and vulnerable to desire (for an unnamed courtesan or Luciana) as the witchcraft Paul sees in Ephesus marked the Ephesians.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coxj1989"><name type="app">Cox</name></ref> (1989, pp. 61, 66–7): <quote>One of the consistent qualifications of socially differentiated style in Shakespeare’s early comedies is their openness to vestiges of medieval dramaturgy. If the well-made comedy was a sign of power, then Shakespeare’s early comedies deconstruct not only the well-structured play but the social assumptions that gave rise to the ruling idea of such a play in the first place.</quote></p>

<p>He discusses the distinction between the romantic <quote>frame</quote> plot and the main plot. (P. 66): <quote part="I">In the context of this consistent distinction between the two stories&hellip;, we can see unmistakable allusions to the archetypal medieval drama that historically underlay the romantic plot. The romantic pattern of separation, wandering, and reunion, as David Bevington points out, derived directly from the moral pattern of fall from grace, temporary domination of evil, and rediscovery of divine favor—the structure that enabled travelling actors to adapt the vast drama of salvation history to the exigencies of a small troupe. What is therefore the oldest story in English drama permeates the language of the frame plot and contributes to its qualitative distinction from the newly fashionable classical action that it encloses. <quote>My fall</quote> is the play’s first rhyme phrase, followed closely by <quote>the doom of death</quote>: <quote>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall / And by the doom of death end woes and all</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0005" targetEnd="#tln_0006">5–6</ref>]). <quote>I am not partial to infringe our laws,</quote> the stern duke insists, identifying himself with harsh perpetrators of the <quote>old law</quote> in medieval dramatic renderings of the history of salvation ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0008">8</ref>]). Those who have not been able to <quote>redeem their lives</quote> before the duke of Syracuse <quote>have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0013">13</ref>]). The familiar romantic dilemma of shipwreck, global wandering, and years of familial separation is thus reinforced with vestiges of the ageless theological dilemma of the fall of humankind and the law of sin and death. Occurring exclusively in the frame story, these casual hints add texture to other differences between it and the Plautine story.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Archetypal drama is again implied in the play’s conclusion.&hellip;Liberation from error and the threat of death are physically enacted when Emilia recognizes Egeon: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1825" targetEnd="#tln_1826">1825–6</ref>].</quote> He adduces Egeon’s ransomless freeing and the <quote>born again</quote> metaphor of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1896">1896</ref>.</p>

<p><quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>&hellip;is more of a hybrid than it appears to be at first, and the social implications of its style are therefore ambiguous. Its neoclassical plot and elegant economy represent an attempt to appropriate fashionable standards, and authorially such an attempt inevitably suggests a desire for the power and prestige that these standards represented—just as certainly as lower-class violation of Elizabethan sumptuary laws represented a desire for the status ascribed to upper-[<hi rend="italic">67</hi>]class clothing. While this pursuit of status is most apparent in Shakespeare’s earliest comedies (and is probably strongest in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>), it is a strategy for social mobility and preservation that Shakespeare never entirely abandons.&hellip;On the other hand, Shakespeare does not press this stratification as hard as he might, and he qualifies it dramaturgically in ways that soften and even reverse its social impact. The most effective image of renewed community&hellip;is presented by the servant twins as the play ends. In contrast to <quote>the enmity and discord</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0009">9</ref>], <quote>the rancorous outrage</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0010">10</ref>] with which the action begins and the classical plot compounds, the frame story concludes with the two Dromios walking amiably to a waiting feast.</quote></p>

From Lyly, too, Shakespeare took the idea of [<hi rend="italic">82</hi>] the underplot, in which some well-marked character, not absolutely necessary to the evolution of the main plot, is brought on stage to amuse the audience with his oddities and witty abuse of language. In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> this part is filled by Dromio of Syracuse, and the following specimen of dialogue&hellip;will, when compared with the extract I have given from <title level="m">Mydas</title>, furnish ample evidence of the cause of the change in Shakespeare’s comic manner: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0443" targetEnd="#tln_0502">443–502</ref>].</quote></p>

<p>John Lyly’s influence appears to have been considerable. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard1a"><name type="app">Cuningham</name></ref> (ed. 1907, p. xxxvi) first notices that a Dromio appears in <title level="m">Mother Bombie</title>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bram1955"><name type="app">Bradbrook</name></ref> (1955, pp. 50–1): <quote>The classic setting, with its three <quote>houses,</quote> the bewildering symmetry of the reduplicated twins harmonize with the quibbles and cross-talk, which is at times (as in the dialogue on Time and Hair between Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse in Act II) even more pedan&shy;[<hi rend="italic">51</hi>]tic than Lyly. It is also, however, a great deal more improper than Lyly, and this reflects the current taste of the young men who enjoyed the poems of Donne.&hellip;In doubling the twins, Shakespeare improved Plautus. This is a characteristically florid Elizabethan device; they liked adjectives in pairs, clauses in antitheses, and Lyly always provided at least two of everything.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg1957"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1957, 1:9): <quote><title level="m">Mother Bombie</title> is a play of duplicated effects and symmetry. It has no fewer than four comic servants who are sent on errands and then searched for by their masters (II.2), and it contains mistaken identities and lost children. Though no close analogue to our play, it supplied the name of its genial rogue who says: <quote>I have nothing to live by but knaverie, and if the world grow honest, welcome beggerie.</quote></quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xxxiii ff.): <quote>There is no doubt that Shakespeare knew the elegant prose plays of John Lyly.&hellip;Of these plays, <title level="m">Mother Bombie</title>, printed 1594, but acted probably in 1590, has closest affinities with <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, as being modelled on Roman comedy, though its plot, in which a group of four gay and witty servants to four old men conspire against them in helping to forward the love-schemes of their masters’ children, is Terentian, rather than Plautine. One of the servants is named Dromio, and Shakespeare may have borrowed the name from this play. [fn.: It should be noted&hellip;that this name is a variant of <title level="m">Dromo</title>, a type-name for a slave in several of Terence’s comedies.] His debt to Lyly, especially in the exchange between the Dromios and their masters, is too general and pervasive, however, to be reduced to a list of borrowings. It is possible to point to a number of phrases or images in Lyly’s works which recur or are echoed in Shakespeare’s play; for instance, I have noticed the following in <title level="m">Mother Bombie</title>: <quote>beg him for a fool</quote> ([1.1.37; <title level="m">Err.</title> 315]); the image of vine and elm ([1.3.124; 568]); of pulling a crow ([2.1.82; 744]); of the parrot crying <quote>rope</quote> ([3.4.57–8; 1326]); <quote>I had thought to have askt you</quote> ([4.1.36; 694]); <quote>there’s a time for al things</quote> ([5.3.15; 458–9]); <quote>sing til we catch cold on our feet</quote> ([5.3.88; 661]); but some of these are proverbial, and some are to be found in other authors of the period also. The number of such echoes has a cumulative weight, especially when, in addition, Shakespeare employs [<hi rend="italic">xxxiv</hi>] formal devices he learned from Lyly, and in the mock dialectics of II.ii, and again in the catechism of III.ii, recalls similar passages in <title level="m">Midas</title>. Lyly’s influence is felt finally in the tone of much of the comic dialogue, the cadences, the cheerful quibbling insolence of the servants, and the casual equality of speech between servant and master, who may nevertheless turn sharply on his <quote>villain</quote> at any minute.</quote></p>

<p>But <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hung1962"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> (1962, pp. 300 ff.) thinks otherwise: <quote part="I">The intrigue of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>&hellip;shows an interest in patterning human behaviour, setting one level against another, which was an art in which Lyly was the obvious master.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Whatever area of common ground Shakespeare shared with Lyly’s mode in comedy, there can be little doubt that the earliest Shakespearian plays show interests which are quite divergent from Lyly’s.&hellip;But the interest of the relationship is not&hellip;to be measured by a list of parallel passages.&hellip;I suppose that the point of comparing Lyly and the early Shakespeare is not to find out what Shakespeare took from Lyly.&hellip;What may be a more fruitful as well as a safer process is to seek a standpoint from which we can see the young Shakespeare <hi rend="italic">differing</hi> from his models.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F"><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> would seem to show Shakespeare’s natural tastes in comedy at a point where he had not absorbed [<hi rend="italic">301</hi>] (or else absorbed and then rejected) the influence of Lyly.

<p>(P. 302): <quote>Either Lyly’s influence has been so absorbed at the beginning of Shakespeare’s career that it does not show, or else it exercises little or no power. I take it that the latter is [more likely].</quote></p>

<p>Luciana brings a wholly non-Plautine atmosphere to the play, but not necessarily one founded on Lyly.</p>

<p><quote part="I">I cannot find&hellip;that the scene where Antipholus <quote>woos</quote> Luciana marks a basic or pervasive break with tradition, or that Lyly is to be held responsible for its manner. It shows us the fairly obvious comedy of the innocent abroad, and of the man who protests too much—though in language of a new eloquence, I admit. What is new in the poetry is not its Lylian elegance&hellip;but rather the strong pathos of man’s loneliness, and this is something that runs counter to Lyly’s flippant and detached view of the man in love.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The doubling of the pair of twin brothers by the pair of twin servants is another innovation made by Shakespeare.

<p><quote part="F">Shakespeare found the non-Plautine elements of the <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> in current tales.

<p xml:id="para_0033"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1961"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1961, pp. 64–5): <quote>Hence, when through his neo-Plautine warp Shakespeare ran a weft dyed in colours of romance, he was making no extreme change from the Latin genre as then frequently understood. Rather, he was overgoing Plautus, and Terence, on their supposed romantic side, as well as on that of comic intrigue. For this purpose, and for <quote>copiousness,</quote> he drew on additional sources. The leading interests of romance—as one might exemplify from Arthurian romances, from <title level="m">The Squire’s Tale</title>, or, coming to the period of our play, from the romance aspects of <title level="m">Arcadia</title> and <title level="m">The Faerie Queene</title>—were adventure; marvel, especially enchantment; the high sentiment of love, and <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">sens</foreign>, the implications brought out in the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">matière</foreign>, the meaning the reader takes away with him, as a result of the author’s treatment. Shakespeare develops into an adventure-story, that of Egeon, the successful quest for the long-lost child which in <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> [<hi rend="italic">65</hi>] is hardly more than a presupposition of the plot. For the initial peril demanded by a plot of this kind, he provides by translating from hoax into fact the situation of the Sienese merchant in Gascoigne’s <title level="m">Supposes</title> where it was already part of a drama of mistaken identities; and by heightening it from a potential threat to goods into a provisional sentence of death. The shipwreck and intervention of piratical fishermen, whereby, Egeon narrates, the family was first divided, have a probable source in Greene’s <title level="m">Menaphon</title>, and form a link with the source of the happy ending, the adventures of Apollonius of Tyre, related by Gower and Twine.</quote> He summarizes the relevant narrative in <title level="a">Apollonius.</title> <quote>The interest of adventure is not confined to the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">dénouement</foreign> and the opening scene; through the alien Antipholus it is carried into the main action. To him it seems that he has a series of adventures with the supernatural. His thoughts and feelings about them, like the providential coincidences that have brought all the members of the family to Ephesus, speak to our sense of marvel. His illusion of supernatural menace in these experiences is set against the real peril of Egeon, and against the truth of his love, even though his love-adventure, which brings the loftiest of love-sentiment into the comedy, seems to him supernatural and at least equivocally perilous too. In the idea of the town as a home of supernatural delusion, Shakespeare is again combining sources. The Epidamnum of <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> (II.i) is notorious for cheats. The denizen’s house there is associated by Shakespeare with Amphitruo’s, a scene of supernatural shape-shifting. Epidamnum itself has changed to Ephesus, no doubt as the site of Diana’s Temple in the Apollonius story, which becomes his Abbey. Diana of the Ephesians inevitably recalls <rs type="bibleref">Acts XIX</rs>, whence Shakespeare would remember, besides the uproar on her account, the references to curious (that is, black) arts practised in Ephesus, and to the exorcists, with whom Dr. Pinch (founded on the Medicus in <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>) has something in common. The Ephesians are warned against supernatural foes in St. Paul’s Epistle, which also exhorts them, Geoffrey Bullough reminds us, to domestic unity, dwelling on the right relationships of husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants. With the father’s rebuke to the wife in <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>, and the long tradition of marital debate in mediaeval and Tudor literature, it thus contributed, no doubt, to the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">sens</foreign> of the play.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_male0001"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> also transcribes the following (3:406): <quote>A Historie of Ferrar, shewed before her Ma<hi rend="superscript">tie</hi> at Wyndesor, on Twelf daie at night, enacted by the Lord Chamberleyne’s servaunts,</quote> an entry for the 1582–3 season at court, more accurately printed by Albert Feuillerat, <title level="m">Documents Relating to the Office of Revels in the Time of Queen Elizabeth</title> (Louvain, 1908, p. 350): <quote>A historie of fferrar shewed before her ma<hi rend="italic">ie</hi>stie at wyndesor on Twelf daie at night Enacted by the Lord Chamberleynes servaunt<hi rend="italic">es</hi> furnished in this office w<hi rend="italic">i</hi>th diverse new thing<hi rend="italic">es</hi> As one Citty, one Battlement of canvas, iij Ells of sarcenet and .x. paire of gloves, and sondry other thing<hi rend="italic">es</hi> in this office whereof some were translated for fitting of the p<hi rend="italic">er</hi>sons &amp;c.</quote></p>

<p>A few years later, this hypothesis had hardened. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_col1"><name type="app">Collier</name></ref> (ed. 1842, 2:109): <quote>The fact, no doubt, is that the clerk who prepared the account merely wrote the title by his ear.

<p>Feuillerat (p. 469) objects to <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_col1"><name type="app">Collier</name></ref>’s inferences: <quote>He is somewhat bold in affirming that his own conjecture is not doubtful.

<p>Egeon’s account of the shipwreck and its consequences, which separated him and S. Antipholus and S. Dromio from the others, returning the first group to Syracuse and fetching the other trio, now separated, up in Ephesus, offers geographical problems that cannot be straightened out. One can take <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref>’s (ed. 1962, p. xxx) position: <quote>There is no reason to demand geographical accuracy from a playwright who elsewhere gave Bohemia a sea-coast, and made a port of Milan. An audience is not likely to be troubled by inconsistencies of detail or inaccuracies in reference to distant and unfamiliar places.</quote> But Foakes goes on to summarize the issues, and so do I.</p>

<p>Sh. changed the location of <title level="m">Err.</title> from the Epidamnus of Plautus to Ephesus, and he decided to tell a shipwreck story to get everyone there. Furthermore, he particularizes the shipwreck by naming cities: Ephesus (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0020">20</ref>), Epidamium (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0045">45</ref>), Corinth (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0090">90</ref>), and Epidarus (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0096">96</ref>), all of which are real, not made-up names, locatable on one currently available map (Ortelius) and in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coot1565"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref>’s (1565) Latin dictionary. (<quote>Epidamium</quote> is usually emended to <quote>Epidamnum,</quote> itself the accusative of <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Epidamnus</foreign>, the form of the word on the map and in Cooper. <quote>Epidarus</quote> is Epidaurus.)</p>

<p>The shipwreck is usually understood to have occurred in the Adriatic or rather the Ionian Sea east of Syracuse (a city on the southern coast of Sicily), somewhere close to the Gulf of Corinth. That locale presents the problem that <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_irv"><name type="app">Marshall</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_irv"><name type="app">Irving</name></ref>, ed. 1888, pp. 109–10) describes, commenting on <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0096">96</ref>, <quote>Of <hi rend="italic">Corinth</hi> that, of <hi rend="italic">Epidarus</hi> this,</quote> referring to the two ships that tried to rescue the survivors clinging to the mast, soon to be split: <quote>This line seems to require a little geographical explanation. The <hi rend="italic">Epidaurus</hi>&hellip;was&hellip;situate in Argolis on the Saronic Gulf [i.e., a little south of Corinth].&hellip;Corinth had two ports, Lechæum on the Gulf of Corinth [i.e., the western port] and Cenchreæ on the Saronic Gulf [the eastern port]. A ship, bound to or coming from the latter port, would come by the same course as one sailing to or from Epidaurus; and they would meet the floating mast&hellip;outside the Ionian Islands [on the western edge of the Gulf of Corinth].&hellip;Ægeon tells us that the storm commenced when they were <quote>a league from Epidamium</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0065">65</ref>]; so that&hellip;the mast&hellip;must have travelled some considerable distance to have reached any spot near the entrance of that gulf.</quote> Epidamium (Epidamnus) is a city, now Durrës (also called Durazzo), in Albania, some 250 miles north of the entrance to the gulf.</p>

<p>To this long journey must be added the fact that there was another Epidaurus north of Epidamnus (now Dubrovnik in Croatia), so that one of the ships may have come from there, closing in from the north on the Corinthian ship coming up from the south.</p>

<p>Sh. had available to him quite confusing information about this geography. Central to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>’s studies of Sh.’s sources was his identification of Dionysius Lambinus’s 1577 edition of Plautus as the one Sh. used, along with Bishop <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coot1565"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref>’s Latin dictionary. If Sh. consulted both of these as <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (ed. 1928, pp. 114–16; 1947, pp. 676–81) insists he did when he read the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>, he would have found the following information. Glossing Plautus’s Prologue, <title level="a">EPIDAMNVM DEVENIT,</title> Lambinus says, <quote xml:lang="la" xml:id="quote_app_003">Dyrrachium venit. Sed Steph. de vrbibus docet duas Epidamnos esse, vnã in Illyrico, alterã in sinu Ionio</quote> (<quote type="trans" corresp="#quote_app_003">He came to Dyrrachium [Durazzo]. But Stephanus in his <title level="a">On Cities</title> teaches that there are two Epidamnuses, one in Illyria [Durazzo] and one on the Ionian gulf</quote>). But Cooper apparently describes only the latter Epidamnus as <quote>a towne in the southeweste parte of Greece on y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> sea syde, called afterward <hi rend="italic">Dyrrachiũ</hi>.</quote> The trouble is, there was no such Achaian Epidamnus. So Sh. learned that Epidamnus was either north in Illyria or southwest in Achaia.</p>

<p>Of Epidaurus <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coot1565"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref> says, <quote>A citie in Greece in the coũtrey called Achaia, wherin was a famous tẽple dedicated vnto Aesculapius, to the which a great multitude of sicke people did resorte.</quote> And he says of Ephesus, <quote>A noble auncient citie in Asia the lesse.&hellip;In this citie was the famous temple of Diana, numbred among the .vii. wonders of the worlde.</quote> These entries in Cooper are on H3<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>–H3<hi rend="superscript">va</hi> of an appendix, Dictionarium Historicum, making browsing easy.</p>

<p>After the separated families are picked up, Egeon and his lot return to Syracuse on the east coast of Sicily, and Æmilia and her lot, at first picked up by <quote>men of <hi rend="italic">Epidamium</hi></quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1841">1841</ref>), then separated by <quote>rude Fishermen of <hi rend="italic">Corinth</hi></quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1843">1843</ref>), made their way eventually to Ephesus; Æmilia was <quote>left with those of <hi rend="italic">Epidamium</hi></quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1845">1845</ref>), i.e., presumably Epidamnus, so how she got to Ephesus is hard to imagine if the shipwreck occurred in the Adriatic, or Ionian, Sea.</p>

<p>This is the position originally taken by <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (ed. 1928, pp. 118–19): <quote>Now the circumstances of the shipwreck are apparently impossible geographically. For these people, wrecked only three miles from Epidamnum [he is using the form <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pope"><name type="app">Pope</name></ref> substituted for Epidamium], start drifting directly for Corinth, some four hundred miles away. Not only do they have a four-hundred-mile objective, but they have a physical impossibility, since their direct course would force them to float overland. This <quote>float</quote> [across the isthmus to Corinth] [<hi rend="italic">119</hi>] would appear even more impossible in old maps than actually it was. Too, the scattering family is taken up by fishermen of Corinth and vessels from Epidaurus and Epidamnum. Evidently Shakespeare thinks of Epidamnum as being near Corinth and Epidaurus, seemingly near the western end of the Gulf of Corinth.</quote> This impossibility leads him to a fantasy of imagining a first version of <title level="m">Err.</title> that would take place in Plautus’s Epidamnus, and a second that shifts events to Ephesus with Sh. not noticing the inconsistencies the shift occasioned. He withdrew the theory in <title level="m">On Act and Scene Division</title> (1965, p. 149).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> judges that Sh. had no map that would help him visualize Egeon’s tale; instead, Sh. relied on Lambinus, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coot1565"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref>, and <rs type="bibleref">Acts 19:19</rs>, which helped him decide on Ephesus as the right setting for <title level="m">Err.</title> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_parg1940"><name type="app">Parks</name></ref> (1940) proposes just such a map, one showing Saint Paul’s journeys, in Abraham Ortelius’s <title level="m">Theatrum orbis terrarum</title> (1570 and later; see <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref>, ed. 1962, Frontispiece; map, <ptr targType="figure" target="#fig_001"/> of this edition, and <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1841-01">n. 1841–7</ref>). Parks shows flaws in Baldwin’s no-map argument (p. 94): <quote>These books are in fact insufficient. In the former [Lambinus], Epidamnus is of course identified, but no other names would naturally be suggested in connection with a play confined to that city. In the latter [Cooper], Epidamnus is also given, and Ephesus preceding it; but the Epidaurus given is the more famous one on the east coast of Greece, not the one Shakespeare had in mind. All that either book could have given would be the identification of Epidamnus. Neither would of itself have suggested the use of Ephesus.</quote> Parks barely hints that Sh. probably chose Ephesus for reasons that had nothing to do with maps or dictionaries.</p>

<p>In Ortelius, Sh. would have found all four E-name cities listed in the (p. 95) <title level="a">Nomina&hellip;Antiqua</title>: <quote>The Epidaurus is moreover the right one, in Illyria, and it is defined in such a fashion as to stick in the memory. That is, it is identified as the modern Ragusa [Dubrovnik], a city well known in England as a vassal state of the Turk and the home of the argosy or Ragusan ship.</quote> On the map all the cities necessary are prominently named save for the nearly invisible Ephesus, just to the right of the isle of Samos in the Aegean sea.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_parg1940"><name type="app">Parks</name></ref> admits he cannot prove that Sh. consulted this map, but he argues that it was available and was (p. 97) <quote>the leading atlas of its time.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (1947, p. 689 n.) rejects Parks on the grounds that Sh. is not known to have seen Ortelius’s map.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1965b"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (<title level="m">Genetics</title>, 1965, pp. 147 ff.) thinks the wreck took place in the Aegean, and he invents a town in Asia Minor called Epidamium located somewhere close to Ephesus. This is a breathtaking solution once one gets past the boldness and the (usual) opacity and incompleteness of the explanation. It depends, though he never says so, on the phrase from Stephanus locating a second Epidaurus <quote><foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">in sinu Ionio</foreign>.</quote> This phrase, normally understood as <quote>on the Ionian gulf,</quote> Baldwin silently takes to mean, as it can, <quote>in the winding coast of Ionia,</quote> <quote>a dist[rict] in the W[est] coast of Asia Minor, extending from Phocæa to Miletus,</quote> an area that includes Ephesus (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_suge1925"><name type="app">Sugden</name></ref> [1925, s.v. Ionia], quoting <rs type="sh" key="Ant."><title level="m">Ant.</title> 1.2.107 [191]</rs>, <quote>And to Ionia</quote>). It also depends on emphasizing the Asia Minor setting of the play, especially <quote>Fiue Sommers haue I spent in farthest <hi rend="italic">Greece</hi>, Roming cleane through the bounds of <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>, And coasting homeward, came to <hi rend="italic">Ephesus</hi></quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0135" targetEnd="#tln_0137">135–7</ref>), where Sh. is following Plautus closely but misunderstanding <quote xml:lang="la">Graeciamque exoticam,</quote> the Greek settlements in southern Italy (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0135-03">135–7</ref>).</p>

<p>In this work, too, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1965b"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> gives Sh. a map, one attached to Acts in the Bishops’ Bible (1573) that labels the cities Paul visited on his missionary journeys. (P. 147): <quote>Now [referring to his chapter 9 where he explains the Asian setting] that we have located <quote>farthest <hi rend="italic">Greece</hi>,</quote> the genetics of the geography of <title level="m">Errors</title> becomes clear. Ephesus and Epidamium are close together in Ionia. Corinth and Syracuse occupy their actual positions, as does Ephesus. We have left only Epidaurus, which comes into <title level="m">Errors</title> with Corinth. Neither Epidamnus nor Epidaurus is on the biblical map, since they are not mentioned in the Bible story.</quote></p>

<p>The only possible Epidaurus for Sh. is the one near Corinth, since (p. 148) <quote>this&hellip;is the only one known to Cooper, and the only one really known in Shakspere’s day.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">149</hi>] Shakspere’s Epidamium was not in Illyricum but alongside Ephesus in Ionia, <quote>farthest <hi rend="italic">Greece</hi>,</quote> <quote>Greece of Asia.</quote></quote> I have not omitted any part of his argument that Sh. invented this Epidamium—which after all is a made-up word somehow based on Epidamnum. <quote part="I">This location makes <quote>plain sailing</quote> of Aegeon’s shipwreck and the sequent wanderings of the family. In <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>, the merchant who stole the twin was of Epidamnus. Being alongside the commercial Ephesus in Ionia of Asia, Epidamium was thus a natural place for Aegeon (made a merchant as was the father of the twins in <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>) to establish a foreign business. In a straight line with each other on the biblical map attached to Acts are Siracusa, the place of departure in <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and retained in <title level="m">Errors</title>, Corīthus [he uses the orthography of the map], and Ephes<hi rend="italic">us</hi>.&hellip;The map would indicate a straight route from Syracuse to Ephesus, with only a slight neck of land to negotiate at Corinth, and this map would be compulsorily available along with the story for grammar school boys of Shakspere’s day.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The location of Epidamnus <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">in sinu Ionio</foreign> by Stephanus and Lambinus had placed for Shakspere Epidamium in Ionia&hellip;alongside Ephesus. Sailing from this nonexistent Epidamium&hellip;on the Aegean Sea was not [<hi rend="italic">150</hi>] lightly to be undertaken.</quote> Here he recounts ancient warnings about the danger of sailing the Aegean. Most important, having the wreck north of Corinth on the Aegean makes sense of <quote>And floating straight, obedient to the streame, Was carried towards <hi rend="italic">Corinth</hi>, as we thought</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0089" targetEnd="#tln_0090">89–90</ref>; see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0089-01">89</ref> [<hi rend="italic">straight</hi>] there, where the <quote>streame</quote> is identified as a well-known current falling out of the Black Sea southwest into the Aegean), whereas a wreck on the Adriatic causes the difficulties already noted. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1965b"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> must think that <quote>Epidamium</quote> was somewhat north of Ephesus, which on the maps of Ortelius and the Bishops’ Bible itself seems to be a bit north of Corinth across the Aegean, though in fact it is a bit south.</p>

<p>The only notice <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1965b"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> gives that he has completely changed his mind about <quote xml:lang="la">in sinu Ionio</quote> is (p. 149): <quote>Since these locations are derived directly, it is not necessary to review the discussions of Epidamnus in Illyricum, to which, following the excellent lead of Irving and Marshall, I have contributed my share,</quote> a wry glance at his 1928 edition. No edition to date has incorporated Baldwin’s bold invention of <quote>this nonexistent Epidamium.</quote></p>

<p>The question of the extent to which <title level="m">Err.</title> is simply farce without the additional enrichment of character that produces comedy gets its most articulate beginnings with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cols1836"><name type="app">Coleridge</name></ref> (1836, 2:114–15): <quote>The myriad-minded man, our, and all men’s, Shakspeare, has in this piece presented us with a legitimate farce in exactest consonance with the philosophical principles and character of farce, as distinguished from comedy and from entertainments. A proper farce is mainly distinguished from comedy by the license allowed, and even required, in the fable, in order to produce strange and laughable situations. The story need not be probable, it is enough that it is possible. A comedy would scarcely allow even the two Antipholises; because, although there have been instances of [<hi rend="italic">115</hi>] almost indistinguishable likeness in two persons, yet these are mere individual accidents, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">casus ludentis naturæ</foreign> [accidents of playful nature], and the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">verum</foreign> [truth] will not excuse the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">inverisimile</foreign> [improbability]. But farce dares add the two Dromios, and is justified in so doing by the laws of its end and constitution. In a word, farces commence in a postulate, which must be granted.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dowe1882"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> (1877; 1882, pp. 65–7) slightly modifies but does not dispute <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cols1836"><name type="app">Coleridge</name></ref>’s view: <quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is Shakspere’s one farcical play. Its sources of laughter lie almost wholly in the situations and incidents, hardly at all in the charac&shy;[<hi rend="italic">66</hi>]ters. The spectator of the play is called on to accept much that is improbable&hellip;for the sake of mere fun and laughter-stirring surprises. So cleverly, however, are the incidents and persons entangled and disentangled, so rapidly does surprise follow surprise, that we are given no time to raise difficulties and offer objections.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">67</hi>] To Shakspere belongs wholly the serious background, from which the farcical incidents stand out in relief.&hellip;There is a fine passage, full of pathos, and almost in Shakspere’s later dramatic manner, where the old man, a prisoner before the duke, finds that his son does not recognise his face, nor remember his voice [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1775" targetEnd="#tln_1803">1775–1803</ref>]; but such passages, in which character or human passion rather than incident chiefly interests us, are rare.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cols1836"><name type="app">Coleridge</name></ref>’s distinction will not do for <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_quia1922"><name type="app">Quiller-Couch</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>, ed. 1922, pp. xxi f.): <quote>With all respect to Coleridge [above] we say that this has the air of special pleading; and we distrust it the more because of its categorizing farce apart from comedy and giving it <quote>laws of its end and constitution.</quote> As a matter of history, and even of nomenclature, farce and comedy never have been and never can be divided into compartments with separate literary laws.&hellip;Who ever made these categories or gave them <quote>laws</quote>?&hellip;There is no line of demarcation—all such lines, or attempts at them, are a professional humbug of criticism. In literature it is all a question of tact. The author persuades us into the right mood.&hellip;We see no point at all in praising the <title level="m">Errors</title> above the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> as the <quote>high water mark of elaborate farce in its highest signification.</quote> It might (though we doubt it) have come near to deserve such praise had Shakespeare not set his artificial farce between the romantic-realism of the distressed merchant&hellip;and of the long-lost wife reclaimed.&hellip;We should prefer to say that in this early play Shakespeare already discloses his propensity for infusing [<hi rend="italic">xxii</hi>] romance into each or every <quote>form</quote> of drama; that unique propensity which in his later work makes him so magical and hard to define. But, as yet, farce and romance were not one <quote>form</quote> but two separate stools; and between them in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> he fell to the ground. We should add, however, that we have never seen it on the boards, for it is seldom staged. There is some evidence that it <quote>acts well</quote>—which, after all, is the test—and even that it provokes uproarious mirth.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1926"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1926, pp. 25–30) takes a middle ground. It is true that there is some interest in <quote>the ethical problems which hinge upon jealousy</quote> and that <quote>it is comedy in the true sense of a criticism of life, which is at heart profoundly serious, and employs all the machinery of wit or humour, with the deliberate intention of reaching through the laughter to the ultimate end of a [<hi rend="italic">26</hi>] purged outlook upon things. Let an audience shake its sides at the plight into which a scold is brought by the railings of her tongue, and it is odds that they will go away with the conviction that the wiser course is not to rail.&hellip;From one point of view, then, <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is to be classed as a comedy.</quote> But if you strip the play of its <quote>ornaments</quote> of the romance plot and the ethics of jealousy, <quote>the interest declares itself as almost entirely one of plot.</quote> He then distinguishes two senses of farce, one merely a variety of comedy which, despite its roughness, still is interested in character, the second being one in which (p. 28) <quote>the interest of character is wholly replaced by an interest of plot. The conception of farce in this sense may be defined as the deduction of a logical conclusion from absurd premises. The playwright starts with some impossible assumption, which you must take for granted; however unconvincing, however grotesque, it is beyond your criticism. From this he proceeds, without any further breach of the probabilities, to show what follows, and to work out a resulting tissue of absurdities, all inherent in the initial situation.</quote> <title level="m">Shr.</title> and <title level="m">Wiv.</title> belong to the first kind, <title level="m">Err.</title> to the second, though there is a (p. 29) <quote>qualification,</quote> namely that although the Ephesian twins do not know they have identical looking brothers, the Syracusan twins must have been told by Egeon of the fact, hence <quote>it is almost incredible that, when they found themselves being obviously and constantly mistaken at Ephesus for persons not themselves, the solution of the puzzle should have failed to suggest itself to them.</quote> Likewise Egeon should have figured out why he was repudiated by someone looking like his Syracusan son. <quote>There are therefore&hellip;two assumptions, not one, made in the play; an assumption of physical [<hi rend="italic">30</hi>] resemblance so close as to be mistaken for identity, and an assumption also of a very singular kind of oblivion in at least two of the personages.</quote> Against the second assumption <quote>we are entitled to protest.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1961"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1961, p. 70): <quote>Dynamic progress is strongly felt in the mounting violence, from the first mere thwack to the drawing of swords, thrashing with a rope’s end, overpowering of <quote>madmen,</quote> and elaborate (narrated) vengeance upon Pinch; in the spreading of error beyond the family to courtesan, goldsmith, and merchant, until the whole town, at least in Adriana’s fevered fancy, seems involved; and in the darkening conviction of the imaginative Antipholus that his supernatural experiences are from the devil. With this explanation, natural to his melancholy temperament, he has positively encased himself in error, for it is as coherent as it is fallacious. In like fashion his choleric brother comes to attribute all his sufferings to a conspiracy instigated by his wife: both the Antipholi reach the verge of persecution-mania. Since Adriana also is given her point of view, which alters before the end, one can say of the three main persons that although they do not develop in the sense of being felt to change in character as a result of the action, their attitudes of mind develop, so that each is felt to have an inner self. That is, they are not wholly flat characters, such as might be fitting protagonists of pure farce. They are simple, but have just enough depth for the play, which Shakespeare, as we have seen, has deepened considerably beyond the expected limitations of neo-classical comedy.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_levh1964"><name type="app">Levin</name></ref> (1964, p. 43): <quote>We are at the roulette table, not the chessboard, here. There is no plotting or counter-plotting in a Machiavellian sense. The sole plotter is the playwright, and whatever that ingenious trickster hatches is fobbed off on us as a trick of fate, a practical joke on the part of providence. For here the mistaken identity is not deliberately cultivated through impersonation or disguise&hellip;; it is a freak of nature, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">lusus naturae</foreign>, which Coleridge advises us to accept as a postulate. And Coleridge philosophizes&hellip;about farce, distinguishing between it and proper comedy as the basis for a distinction between the possible and the probable. A set of identical twins, leading different lives, constitutes an improbable possibility. The distinction is sometimes drawn in terms of character and plot: farce tends to subordinate the former to the latter.</quote></p>

<p>Sh.’s doubling of the twins presses the limits of possibility. <quote>If that was a reduction to absurdity, absurdity is man’s lot as the Existentialists have redefined it, and what should a farce be if not wholly absurd?</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berr1972"><name type="app">Berry</name></ref> (1972, p. 25): <quote>It [<title level="m">Err.</title>] is in fact two plays, a farce and a comedy, most expertly synthesized. Farce, essentially mechanistic, requires that we look on all of the dramatis personae from outside.&hellip;But Shakespeare presents characters from the inside, that is to say he depicts people who have stumbled into the world of farce and do not understand its laws. The farce play here is merely the record of the mechanical errors based on mistaken identity. The comedy is the study of the reactions of the characters to the farce in which they find themselves.&hellip;There are&hellip;two major objections to terming <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> a farce; the frame to the action, pregnant with tragedy, and the fact that the characters consistently refuse to be mechanized.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_turr1974"><name type="app">Turner</name></ref> (1974, pp. 166–7, 177): <quote part="I">Recent critics&hellip;make much of Antipholus’s declaration of love and connect it with Egeon’s sentence of death, the addition of Emilia, Antipholus of Syracuse’s soliloquies on identity, and the family reunion to show how Shakespeare <quote>deepened</quote> his source play. Implicit in their argument is an understanding of farce as some lesser form in a hierarchy of genres, inappropriate to Shakespeare’s genius; so they set out to show how even his first comedy goes beyond the limitations of farce by adding such topics as <quote>death,</quote> <quote>love,</quote> or <quote>identity</quote> that have special value in themselves.&hellip;If indeed themes can have value apart from the way they are dramatized, one might respond that in this play the experiences of love and marriage serve to develop the theme of what constitutes identity. Had Shakespeare intended to develop such an ideal relationship between man and woman, he missed his chance in Act V, where Luciana and Antipholus of Syracuse could have expressed their sentiments. Yet they remain completely silent.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">167</hi>] I question whether the farce is to be praised because of its <quote>serious</quote> issues. Surely the problem for analysis is to show how Shakespeare puts such topics to comic uses.&hellip;Isn’t it the very power of farce to transmute potential threats and <quote>serious</quote> themes to matters for laughter and joy? Shakespeare appears to be testing the power of his story by the very lengths to which he adds what would otherwise be <quote>serious.</quote> Rather than separate the <quote>comic intrigue</quote> and <quote>comic rhetoric</quote> from the themes, we should ask how it is that themes, quite serious in other contexts, become the stuff of farce.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The neo-classical principles of sixteenth-century humanists cannot satisfy all our questions about the dynamics of comic attitudes, but they can prevent us from overemphasis on sentiments of love or sympathy for a condemned father, a misunderstood wife, or a beaten servant.&hellip;Farce affords its distinctive pleasures that arise from its very limitations. It has the power to make us laugh at cuckolds, shrews, beaten servants, unpaid goldsmiths, unjust laws, even potential incest. Shakespeare did indeed change and add to his source play, but to make it more the kind of drama that it is, not to romanticize or soften it.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">177</hi>] <quote part="F">Much of the low comic behavior arising from the improprieties of master and servant is slapstick. The brothers Antipholi are harsh masters, irritable to the point of beating their servants.&hellip;The Dromios&hellip;as best they can, carry out the offices of servant, and strangely it is because they are unjustly punished that we laugh.&hellip;We laugh not because we experience a surprise but because we are forced to acknowledge an unpleasant fact that we would rather ignore, that some human beings are victimized regardless of their good nature.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gurm1975"><name type="app">Gurewitch</name></ref> (1975, pp. 84 ff.) says that comedy usually searches for truth: <quote>It is surely noble to argue that comedy is a mode of combating the tendency of the human mind to harbor faulty knowledge. Nevertheless, the comedy of truth is not all the truth about comedy. Undeniably, the ends of comedy are often served by a quest for clarification and wisdom; and this quest may reasonably be considered the analogue of a series of laboratory experiments. But a razor-edged awareness of the illogical stresses and strains in human thought and conduct is not the whole preoccupation of comic energy. Whereas satiric comedy&hellip;delights in the laughing murder of untenable ideas, ironic comedy treats ideas only as colorful or [<hi rend="italic">85</hi>] intriguing toys. Farcical comedy is more devastating: it promotes a subversion of mind itself by seeking out the powerful pleasures of irrationality. And humorous comedy not only tolerates man’s proneness to make mistakes, but even cherishes his fallible biases and pieties.</quote></p>

<p>(P. 89): Sh. <quote part="I">does not forsake the privileges of nonsense bequeathed to him by Plautus.&hellip;The two irrationalities (lunatic misidentification and romantic passion) harmonize in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> largely because disparate aggressors against reason tend to become partners willy-nilly, [<hi rend="italic">90</hi>] one incredibility helping to beget another.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The extraordinary family reunion&hellip;when father, mother, twin sons, and twin servants are all recovered, is a soothing fantasticality but also a weak one (getting rid of the elations of incoherence at the end of a comedy of errors is always a letdown).</quote></p>

<p>He offers a critique of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_levh1964"><name type="app">Levin</name></ref> above. (P. 91): <quote part="I">But Levin is tempted to transform the whirligig of chance into more drastic and more modern comic mischief; and in his analysis of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> he finally embraces both the metaphysics (not just the presence) of contingency and the madness of farce. Paying homage to Shakespeare’s daring in presenting the absurdity of two sets of twins, Levin suggests that there is really nothing astounding here: <quote>Absurdity is man’s lot as the Existentialists have redefined it, and what should a farce be if not wholly absurd?</quote>&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">But&hellip;a <quote>wholly absurd</quote> farce would contain impieties and outrages that are nonexistent in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>. Shakespeare’s farce is a delightfully tricky dislocation of logic and sense, but in other respects it is a small solvent for psychic repression. Levin’s metaphor of the roulette table suggests well enough that the nonsense in Shakespeare’s comedy has its boundaries: it leaps about within a patterned chanciness and a comparatively polite ambience. It [<hi rend="italic">92</hi>] is no step toward nihilism and no summons to festive riot. Thus <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> does not exemplify Levin’s assertion that <quote>the carnival spirit</quote> is <quote>the first condition of comedy,</quote> comedy itself being a <quote>release from the rules, a dispensation from the routine duties of existence.</quote>&hellip;<title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> may break the rules of inference, but it does not open the floodgates of carnival.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">33</hi>] <quote part="M">The effect of such farcical structures on Shakespearian comedy is not hard to discover.

The worlds they are found in demand that they accept an ethos that they barely understand and that they would rather exploit than accept. Their careers are marked by a series of attempts to impose themselves on an environment that can only regard them as aberrant. And being aberrant they are too weak to succeed in their impositions. One is a puzzled foreigner.&hellip;Energy, willfulness, determination to keep on moving, may allow the protagonist to win the occasional battle, but he or she is bound to lose the war, for all the eventual advantages lie with the social body.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">34</hi>] In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> each discovery by an Antipholus that the world is alien is complemented by an assurance that it is familiar and welcoming.&hellip;The unceasing and manic energy of farce in these plays comes from the central characters’ unrelenting determination to reject complicity with the world around them. But we can see well enough that complicity is the only fate available. The unity of the play’s world demands that the opponents finally admit that they belong to one another. Antipholus of Ephesus rejects with a torrent of vituperation the kindly-meant diagnosis of Doctor Pinch, wife, and neighbors; but the community is not put off by his rejection. They think of his <quote>madness</quote> as simply the deprivation of their <quote>normality,</quote> their efforts being bent entirely toward what they see (properly enough) as his recovery of full status as a healthy and accepting member of society.</quote></p>

<p>(P. 81): <quote>To a great extent, the comedy of <title level="m">Errors</title> arises from the number of barriers Shakespeare has erected</quote> to thwart the normal movement in comedy to reconciliation. <quote>The greatest obstacles arise in the principal characters’ relations with their servants, in the arena of commerce, and in the realm of speech itself.

The comedy is middle-class and Plautine and farcical, and so uncharacteristic of Shakespeare: for the earliest play that really shows us the shape of Shakespearian comedy to come is <title level="m">The Two Gentlemen</title>. But already in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> there is the sense of fun without reference to the correction of manners, the fun of a man who in certain moods finds the vagaries of human nature and human life a theme for amused and sympathetic comment. In the grief of the jealous wife Adriana, which breaks the bonds of the Plautine convention, there is more than a hint that to this dramatist comedy is to be not merely comedy of humours or manners, but profound comedy, and that women are to play as [<hi rend="italic">120</hi>] prominent a part in it as men. We shall not expect to find, in this middle-class setting, in this whirl of mistaken identity, examples of the conversation of men and women of good breeding, of the exquisite social tact which by nature or nurture was at [his] command;&hellip;yet am I being merely fanciful in seeing anticipations of this gracious world of courtesy and civility in such a chance phrase as: <quote>Sir, I commend you to your own content</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0195">195</ref>].

Unfortunately, his lady is Luciana, who believes him to be her own brother-in-law and thinks his pledges of love the utterings of a mind vilely deranged. Emboldened by the fervor that the religion of love inspires, however, Antipholus protests his regeneration by the power of love [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0826" targetEnd="#tln_0827">826–7</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">This admixture of the religion of love and classic farce with the resultant transformation of love farce into the romance of marriage exemplifies the English habit of freely transferring conventions from one decorum to another,</quote> a practice condemned by Continental theorists but enjoyed by English practitioners.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lega1974"><name type="app">Leggatt</name></ref> (1974, pp. 3–4, 8, 18–19): <quote part="I">The market-place atmosphere of Plautus is still present, but it no longer monopolizes the play; it is varied by suggestions of fantasy and mystery, and the result is a mixture of styles that goes much deeper than changes from verse to prose, or the varying of metres. It is a mixture of different ways of viewing the world, of which different dramatic styles are ultimately a reflection. Nor is the decision to mix idioms in this way artificially imposed; it springs from Shakespeare’s own fresh and imaginative meditation on the central idea of Plautus, the idea of confusion.&hellip;And in exploiting the situations arising from [confusion], Shakespeare demonstrates that confusion, the gap of understanding between one mind and another, can exist at a deeper level than who’s-got-the-chain or which-twin-is-it-<hi rend="italic">this</hi>-time.&hellip;The characters seem at times to inhabit different worlds, different orders of experience.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Some of this effect is created by the mingling—and, at times, the collision—of dramatic styles. In II.ii Adriana, meeting the man she thinks is her husband, attacks him passionately for straying [<hi rend="italic">4</hi>] from her.&hellip;Taken out of context, the speech is passionate and earnest.&hellip;But the context is all-important. Adriana’s speech follows immediately—with no transition whatsoever—a racy comic turn between Dromio and Antipholus on time, falling hair and syphilis; she breaks in on two characters who are operating in quite a different dramatic world. And any chance we might have of making the transition from one mode to the other and taking Adriana’s speech seriously is killed by the fact that all her high talk about the closeness of the marriage bond is directed at the wrong Antipholus.</quote> On <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1224" targetEnd="#tln_1233">1224–33</ref>, <quote part="I">Here, the attitude of each character is comically dislocated. The courtesan is simply living her casual, material life, while Antipholus is struggling between heaven and hell.&hellip;The contrast is driven home, once again, by the different styles of speech—the casual chatter of the courtesan, the explosive horror of Antipholus, and on the side, Dromio’s more familiar recognition of the powers of evil.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">18</hi>] <quote part="F">The play presents a story starting from a fantastic premise and moving to an almost equally fantastic conclusion. But at the same time, for all its artificiality, it deals with the most normal and intimate relations of life—wives and husbands, parents and children. In comparing the different worlds the Antipholus brothers inhabit, we saw an intersection of the special and fantastic with the normal and everyday—Ephesus as a town of sorcerers, and as a town of merchants. The same intersection of the fantastic and the normal becomes part of the audience’s own experience as it watches the play—a strange and stylized fable built out of the most familiar relationships of life. The result of this interweaving of the fantastic and the everyday is to make us see each kind of experience from the perspective of the other—just as Antipholus of Syracuse is brought to see the ordinary tradesmen as <quote>Lapland sorcerers</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1194">1194</ref>], or the Abbess sees the coincidental rejoining of a long-sundered family as an event as natural as childbirth. The comic strategy of the play is one of dislocation, forcing us to see [<hi rend="italic">19</hi>] experiences from a fresh perspective, reminding us that no one understanding of life is final. The mixed dramatic mode gives shading and variety to what could have been a one-note, mechanical farce; but it also embodies a comic vision of the instability of life itself.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_frem1981"><name type="app">French</name></ref> (1981, p. 77) sees the play as contrasting the outlaw feminine principle with the inlaw masculine principle that seeks order. The essay comprises assertions, unsupported by quotation, about many kinds of such principles as the following:</p>

<p><quote part="I">The surface life of Ephesus&hellip;is firmly in the control of the masculine principle. The political background is a power struggle between two cities which has resulted in a law which is inhumane but legitimate, and is thus an example of that principle in an oppressive form. Aegeon’s lack of money (power) traps him in the law, and as a result, his life is forfeit. The Duke, who represents this set of values, is moved by Aegeon’s story, but insists he <quote>may not disannul</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0147">147</ref>]) the law. Nevertheless, at the end&hellip;he does precisely that: there is no mention of the fine at the end. This change cannot be attributed to a psychological shift in the Duke; it is a result of the moral revision of the entire society that develops from the events of the comedy.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The two gender principles appear at their worst at the opening of the play. The feminine is outlaw, connected with sorcery and rebelliousness; the masculine is oppressive, inhumane. And the world depicted is an unhappy one: a husband and wife quarrel with each other; a husband is unfaithful; a wife is jealous and rebellious; servants are brutalized; greed and competitiveness imbue male relationships. The bonds linking this society are codified into law, but law does not keep E. Antipholus from frequenting a courtesan, Adriana from feeling resentment, masters from beating their servants.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_crej1982"><name type="app">Crewe</name></ref> (1982, p. 203): <quote part="I">I&hellip;consider <quote>the playwright</quote> implied in the play rather than the William Shakespeare whom we believe on good authority to have written <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>.

The <quote>rationality</quote> of this playwright is not&hellip;to be taken for granted—on the familiar if radically untenable assumption, for example, that Shakespeare <quote>always knows what he is doing</quote>—but is itself at stake in the play. The achievement of a <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">rationale</foreign> for <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, and thus of a rational identity for the playwright, requires both that the arbitrariness of the play’s inherited conventions and the farcical character of the comedy of mistaken identity in some measure be redeemed.

<p><quote part="F">The implied playwright&hellip;manifests himself either as a benevolent deity, omniscient and omnipotent, whose good will anticipates the entire course of the play, or as a <quote>good physician,</quote> working through comic conventions to purge melancholy, impart self-knowledge, and exorcise psychic demons.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hung1997"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> (1997, pp. 118–20): <quote part="I">The gap between the Inns of Court production of <title level="m">Supposes</title> and that of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>&hellip;measures [<hi rend="italic">119</hi>] the whole story of the establishment of Elizabethan commercial drama. By the time of Shakespeare’s play there was a well-founded professional theatre in London with a considerable repertory and a sophisticated technique to express the nuance of individual experience. And Shakespeare draws directly on this inheritance in handling his story of old Aegeon, the despairing father of a disintegrated family who is brought into <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> to confront the hard-headed world of Plautine farce.&hellip;In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>&hellip;we begin not with the society [of the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>] but with the intruder and victim, old Aegeon, and in the light of his experience we see the traveller less in terms of his adaptability than his disorientation, his loneliness, his despair of ever finding his family.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The clear opposition&hellip;between fact and fiction [in <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>], sense and sensibility, seems to be one that Shakespeare is not anxious to preserve.

But Shakespeare apparently is happy to suggest that the factual details of our experience cannot be extricated from the explanatory matrix of our romantic fictions. <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> derives the <quote>true</quote> story of old Aegeon&hellip;from the <quote>mouldy tale</quote> of</quote> Gower’s Apollonius of Tyre.</p>

With respect to the material environment, it establishes an imperial project that expands the emerging capitalist economy at the same time that it satisfies the particular economic needs of unlanded gentlemen. With respect to controlling ideology, it articulates that material project in terms appropriated from the traditional code of chivalry.

His emotion helps to float the strange episode of the mast that served as a <quote>helpful ship</quote> (line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0106">106</ref>]) to save the lives of six, and then to divide them nicely into the two triads required by the plot. But the author fails to bring out unmistakably the sole aspect of the tale that could render it fully plausible, namely its weirdness or uncanniness. Certainly this note is present, but not explicitly enough.&hellip;Relatively too much stress is placed on the pathos of the romance, and too little on its weirdness. This error is not made in the final scene of the play. There the pathetic joy of the recognition and reunion&hellip;is skilfully intermixed with the characteristic comedy of this drama.</quote></p>

<p>The second scene is artfully attached to the first. (P. 99): <quote part="I">The fine point&hellip;is that his [S. Antipholus’s] very air [of gravity] is felt to be <hi rend="italic">fathered</hi> by Aegeon’s, though quite different. The old man’s voluble gloom gives place to the son’s sober sadness.

<p><quote part="F">Meanwhile (II, i) high comedy [i.e., comedy of character], centred in Adriana, comes upon the scene. From now on, it gleams through the pattern of the play like a thin gold thread, appearing and disappearing.</quote> Adriana is comically impatient. <quote>That [louring (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0362">362</ref>)] look goes along with conduct, potentially at least, violent. And certainly the heroine&hellip;has her full share in its mad doings. Yet louring impatience is merely on the surface of her; deep beneath is a devoted, yearning love for her husband.</quote></p>

<p>The pathos of Adriana is subordinated; we are amused by her exaggerations, especially her <quote>great blaze of jealousy</quote> at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0363" targetEnd="#tln_0391">363–91</ref> when she hears about Antipholus’s behavior.</p>

<p>Her confrontation with the wrong Antipholus, 505–39, is especially fine. (P. 101): <quote>How direct and powerful is the style here over against the neat, conventional rhetoric of the preceding quotation.&hellip;Here the pathos, by itself, would be too keen for comedy. But it is checked for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks of her two Syracusan listeners, wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by the mirth, madder than ever, that ensues.</quote></p>

<p>Other points that he makes: Dromio’s report of the spherical Nell (p. 102) <quote>is a superb burlesque</quote> of the wooing of Luciana by S. Antipholus.</p>

<p>S. Dromio and his master are <quote>overcome by a dreamlike sense of transformation [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0583" targetEnd="#tln_0587">583–7</ref>], romantic in the master, grotesque [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0597">597</ref>] in the man.</quote></p>

<p>Sh. <quote part="I">refrains from bringing Nell onto the stage in person. The temptation to do so must have been great; the scene would have rejoiced the hearts of ninety per cent of his audience.&hellip;</quote></p>

The pathos of his appeal to him whom he takes to be <quote>my only son</quote> is very moving, but, of course, it is checked by his mistaking Antipholus of Ephesus for him of Syracuse. Thus Aegeon is drawn into the atmosphere of illusion; so is even the stiff-backed Duke a little later (line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1850">1850</ref>]). The tearful joys of the reunion of the old man’s family are finely interwoven with enchanting mistakes (lines [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1816" targetEnd="#tln_1905">1816–1905</ref>]), and parodied at the close by the conference of the two Dromios. When Dromio of Syracuse declares to his new-found brother (italics mine),

<quote rend="block">There is a fat <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> at your master’s house

the speaker’s sense of relief is as vast as the girth of Nell. This speech brings us back towards everyday reality.

None of the crucial events is effected by anyone’s conscious purpose, except the pardoning of Aegeon.&hellip;Aegeon is present not to evoke emotion but to serve the ends of comedy; he acts as expositor in the beginning, and his uncertain fate sustains curiosity when our interest might flag because the unraveling of a plot based on mistaken identity is so singularly predictable.</quote></p>

<div type="level3" xml:id="div_themes_general">
<head>General Comments</head>

<p>Two essays cover the themes in a compendious way. Studies that follow these two often elaborate what they sometimes merely mention.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1961"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1961, pp. 66–9): <quote part="I">However they [the themes] are deepened and interconnected by Shakespeare’s treatment, they are not recondite: for the audience, they are the general ideas arising most naturally from the motives and development of the plot, and the response of the characters. The play begins and ends with relationship: a family torn asunder and reunited. Relationship is the motive that has brought Egeon, and the alien Antipholus and Dromio, to the hazards of Ephesus; relationship is threatened by the tensions in the marriage of Antipholus the denizen. The chief entanglements spring from mistaken identity and mistiming:

<quote rend="block">I see we still did meet each other’s man,
<lb/>And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,
<lb/>And thereupon these <hi rend="smcaps">errors</hi> are arose. [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1875" targetEnd="#tln_1877">1875–7</ref>]</quote>

The twins appear the same, but in reality are different; those who meet them are led by appearance into illusion. Repeatedly one of the persons assumes that he shared an experience with another, when in reality he shared it with a different one. In consequence, the persons cease to be able to follow each other’s assumptions, and become isolated in more or less private worlds. Mistakes of identity all but destroy relationship, and loss of relationship calls true identity yet more in question; the chief persons suspect themselves or are suspected of insanity, or of being possessed, surrounded, or assailed by supernatural powers—madness or demoniac possession would be the eclipse of the true self, and sorcery might overwhelm it. The alien Antipholus and Dromio fear Circean metamorphosis; Egeon, that he has been deformed out of recognition by time. Yet the hazard of metamorphosis and of the loss of present identity is also the way to fresh or restored relationship. Antipholus the bachelor desires that Luciana will transform him and create him new; and Adriana’s belief that in marriage the former identities coalesce and emerge identified with each other, is true if rightly interpreted. How the possessive interpretation, not relinquished by Adriana till almost the end, is at odds with the free giving and hazarding in which the wealth and debts of love differ from those of commerce, is another central theme, well traced by J. R. Brown. Adriana’s envy of a husband’s status contravenes principles of order that for Shakespeare and orthodox Elizabethans extended through the whole cosmos. The status of husband, and of wife, Kate’s lines in <title level="m">The Shrew</title> imply, are related to their places in this hierarchical order:

<quote rend="block">Such duty as the subject owes the prince
<lb/>Even such a woman oweth to her husband. [<rs type="sh" key="Shr.">2713–14</rs>]</quote></quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">67</hi>] <quote part="M">Adriana comes to style her husband lord, and they each lay their case, as each has come to see it, before the Duke, reminding themselves and him that the match was first made by his authority. By this point, disorder from the various disruptions of relationship has gone so far in the community, that only the appeals for justice addressed to the Abbess and to him, God’s viceroys spiritual and temporal, are capable, the time now being ripe, of leading to a solution.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Not only are the themes organically developed in the action; they are organically connected in themselves. At the centre is relationship: relationship between human beings, depending on their right relationship to truth and universal law: to the cosmic reality behind appearance, and the cosmic order. Trust in mere appearance results in illusion and mistakes of identity, thus dislocating relationship, and so disrupting order: blind conflict and disorder are inevitable when men misconceive true identity and become isolated in private worlds. Besides illusion, there are other factors of disorder: revolt against a wife’s place in the cosmic hierarchy is the original source of discord in Adriana’s marriage: order is broken, too, by everything untimely. As Ovid’s <title level="m">Tempus edax rerum</title>, time opposes mutability to the creative cosmic order. By that mutability, identity itself may be threatened: <quote><foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Nec species sua cuique manet</foreign>&hellip;</quote>—the link of time-theme and appearance-theme is present in Ovid, and particularly clear in the apostrophe to Time wrung from Egeon when he finds himself unrecognized. Here, and in the dread of Circean transformation into beasts, metamorphosis is seen in its hostile aspect; but, as we have observed, it can also transform for the better: time, too, when it is ripe, brings a new order. Till then, patience would mitigate disorder, which cannot be ended till the claims for justice, distorted by the claimants’ assumption that their private worlds are real, are laid before those who in the hierarchy of order are founts of justice upon earth. More than justice is needed: without mercy, the godly prince is not himself; and amid the demonstrations of love’s wealth, lacking which there would be little of the genial warmth that glows in the conclusion, Solinus is inspired to what he had declared impossible, and freely remits the debt Egeon owes the law. In this organic structure, of the two themes which next to relationship are the most inclusive, the first, cosmic order, presides in Shakespeare’s early Histories; its importance in his drama is well recognized, and the importance of the second, appearance and reality, is becoming so. The first is a familiar part of <quote>the Elizabethan world-picture</quote>; the second, presumably, has affiliations with Renaissance neo-Platonism.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">68</hi>] <quote part="M">The themes are given prominence in several ways. They are voiced by the speakers, who often relate one theme to another: the examples in our analysis of I. ii are characteristic. The dominant imagery, of man as beast, reflects the ideas of illusory appearance and malign metamorphosis; above all, it mirrors the threats to identity and to status in the cosmic order. Appropriately, it stops on the brink of the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">dénouement</foreign> with the Duke’s explicit formulation:

<quote rend="block">I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup. [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1747">1747</ref>]</quote></quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Thematic, likewise, are the two images of the water-drop, its identity lost for relationship’s sake. The whole harmonic structure, of which the correspondence of images forms part, is a vehicle of the themes. How generosity and two degrees of possessiveness in love are defined by juxtaposition of <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scènes</foreign> in III. ii, with reference back to Adriana’s attitude in Act II, has been shown by J. R. Brown. The supreme instance is the parallel between the <quote>gossips’ feast</quote> to which everyone is going at the end, and the dinner from which the husband and his guests were shut out. The gossips’ or baptismal feast affirms relationship and identity: the kin are united, the Duke is patron, all are friends and godparents; witnesses to the identities now truly established and christened into the family and the community; long travail is rewarded, and increase (the progressive aspect of cosmic order) which, despite the double birth of twins, was mocked by the intervention of mutable fortune, is now truly realized. It is not only as a sensational error of identity that the exclusion from dinner contrasts with this: balked or broken feasts (G. Wilson Knight has made us aware) are recurrent symbols in Shakespeare of the breakdown of human fellowship and its pieties. Both this motif, and the extravagant comedy of the barring-out, are worked up by the burlesque Lylyan or Erasmian colloquy on whether good cheer or welcome makes the feast. The burlesque <quote>turns</quote> for the clowns belong to the harmonic structure in much the same way.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xliv ff.): <quote>The serious force of the presentation of the Antipholus twins is paralleled by a more comic treatment of their servants. Each is puzzled at being mistaken for the other, and each comes to feel that he is being transformed—but into an ass, rather than another person. So Dromio of Ephesus suffers like an ass from the blows of his master ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0637">637</ref>]), and, finding that another has assumed his office and identity as a servant in Adriana’s household, and that for his service he is rewarded with still more blows as his master grows angrier, he resigns himself to his topsy-turvy world with a humorous acceptance of it: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1308" targetEnd="#tln_1313">1308–13</ref>].</quote> S. Dromio likewise speaks of transformation: (p. xlv) <quote part="I">[Quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0590" targetEnd="#tln_0597">590–7</ref>].&hellip;Each Dromio applies the term <quote>ass</quote> in relation to the beatings he is made to suffer&hellip;but the idea of being made a beast operates more generally in the play, reflecting the process of passion overcoming reason, as an animal rage, fear, or spite seizes on each of the main characters.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">For the sense of loss or change of identity in these figures goes together with a disruption of family, personal, and social relationships. Antipholus of Syracuse loses himself in the search for his mother and brother, but is hailed by all in Ephesus as if they knew him well; even as he thinks that he is subject to <quote>imaginary wiles</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1193">1193</ref>]), he is, unwittingly, causing a rift in the marriage of Adriana and his brother, and stirring discord between Antipholus of Ephesus and, on the one hand Angelo&hellip;, on the other hand the Courtesan, over the matter of the chain. In the confusion which follows upon his dining with Adriana, the new self he had found in his passion for Luciana is frustrated; confirmed in his belief that he wanders in illusions ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1225">1225</ref>]), he comes on at the end of Act IV, sword in hand, to drive her and Adriana off as <quote>witches.</quote> At the same time, Antipholus of Ephesus, denied entry to his own house, comes to believe that he is the victim of a plot, and that his wife is a <quote>strumpet</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1416">1416</ref>]).&hellip;The normal intercourse of the city in its friendly, commercial relationships is also disturbed, to the extent that the Second Merchant, believing himself wronged, [<hi rend="italic">xlvi</hi>] puts both Angelo and Antipholus under arrest, and the long-standing trust between these two is destroyed. The confusions of identity, involving for Antipholus of Syracuse and the two Dromios a sense especially of loss or transformation, and for Antipholus of Syracuse a need defiantly to assert his identity in a world that seems to go mad, thus lead to a breakdown of the social order through the frustration of personal relationships. Quarrels and arrests follow.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The growth of this disorder is reflected in two other strands in language and action which reinforce the serious undertones of the comedy. One is the establishment of Ephesus as a place associated with witchcraft. Antipholus of Syracuse arrives there with a prejudice about the city: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0263" targetEnd="#tln_0268">263–8</ref>].</quote> Foakes lists the witchcraft passages, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0832">832</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0834">834</ref>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0946">946</ref>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1249">1249</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1250">1250</ref>. <quote part="I">The prejudice which he has on reaching Ephesus provides a ready explanation for all the strange things that happen to him, and becomes a settled conviction; he is more and more dis&shy;[<hi rend="italic">xlvii</hi>]abled from distinguishing between what is real and what is not, until the whole city seems to him to be in the grip of an evil power: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1224" targetEnd="#tln_1226">1224–6</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Antipholus of Ephesus, by contrast, regards himself as alone sane in a world gone mad. He is given some force of character, and a tendency to violence, so that when he is shut out of his own house, he is driven to bewilderment and to passionate exclamation; though calmed for a moment by Balthasar, he thinks of punishing his wife by going at once to the Courtesan’s, and by bestowing a <quote>rope’s end</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0998">998</ref>]), i.e. a whipping, upon Adriana and her <quote>confederates.</quote> He invents an explanation of her treatment of him with this word; he decides he is the victim of a conspiracy</quote> confirmed by the incidents that befall him thereafter.</p>

<p><quote>The confusions of identity and consequent disruptions of normal relationships force the characters to judge events according to their own private ordering of experience, as Adriana, too, is ready, at the suggestion of the Courtesan, to think her husband mad, and treat him as a dangerous lunatic. Out of the clashes of these private worlds of experience emerges another strand in language and action which is of some importance, a sense of evil at work in Ephesus. Dromio of Syracuse jests about the Officer who arrests Antipholus of Ephesus, calling him a devil, <quote>One that, before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1149">1149</ref>]); he is quibbling on the last judgment, and on a common term for prison, but his jest, as is characteristic of the word-play of the Dromios, quickly becomes earnest when he meets his own master in the next scene [fn. comparing jokes on mistiming—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0205">205</ref> ff., <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0450">450</ref> ff.—<quote>which turn out to have a bearing on the disorder later in the play</quote>—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0450" targetEnd="#tln_0503">450–503</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1025" targetEnd="#tln_1067">1025–67</ref>—<quote>and the way in which Dromio of Syracuse both parodies and reinforces his master’s prejudices in his account of the kitchen-wench, Nell</quote>—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0933">933</ref>]. For Antipholus of Syracuse really thinks of the Courtesan as a <quote>fiend,</quote> and uses to her Christ’s words, <quote>Satan, [<hi rend="italic">xlviii</hi>] avoid,</quote> spoken in rejection of the devil’s temptation in the wilderness; and if the Officer was a <quote>devil in an everlasting garment</quote> to Dromio, the Courtesan now becomes <quote>the devil’s dam.</quote> A little later, Adriana puts her husband, as a man possessed by the <quote>fiend,</quote> into the hands of an exorcist, who chants, [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1338" targetEnd="#tln_1339">1338–9</ref>]. These hints of the devil at work mark a stage in the play when the appearance of normal order breaks down, and the action erupts into violence, as one Antipholus is bound, and the other rushes in to attack a group he believes are <quote>witches</quote>—a group that includes the Officer of the law.</quote></p>

<p>In Act 5, Egeon, bound, comes on with the Duke, the representative of justice, who is appealed to by Adriana and then E. Antipholus for justice. <quote>Each clamours for an idea of justice based on a private ordering of experience, and the conflicting evidence of witnesses and supporters sets a problem too difficult for the law to solve; the Duke cries, [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1747" targetEnd="#tln_1748">1747–8</ref>]. His words nicely suggest the kind and degree of transformation that has taken place in the citizens of Ephesus; they are behaving madly, and there is no order or coherence in what they allege against one another.</quote></p>

<p><quote>To make matters worse, Egeon seizes the opportunity to appeal [<hi rend="italic">xlix</hi>] for help to the son he sees before him, but Antipholus of Ephesus does not know him. The law cannot deal with this situation, and it is time for the Abbess to reappear, with the second Antipholus.</quote> The mistakes are explained. <quote>It is as if, through her intervention, the harsh justice embodied in the Duke is tempered by a Christian grace and mercy.&hellip;Here the characters recover or discover their real identity, order is restored, and the two pairs of twins follow the others off stage.&hellip;Violence is replaced by mildness and love, and the sense of witchcraft, evil, and Circean transformation is dispelled.</quote></p>

<p>He quotes Wylie Sypher, <title level="m">Comedy</title> (1956, p. 22) and Northrop Frye, <title level="a">The Argument of Comedy,</title> <title level="m">English Institute Essays</title> (1948, p. 61) on how comedy is a triumph over mortality and the means by which an individual is freed from unwanted social bonds, saying that these formulations, while too grand for <title level="m">Err.</title> in total, have some relevance. (P. <hi rend="italic">xlix</hi>): <quote part="I">The terms of the first description are too large&hellip;, but clearly they have some relevance; there is the hint of a sacrifice in Egeon, the hero-victim brought to the point of death, and the comic action leads in its vitality to a kind of resurrection, a rebirth, the baptismal feast at the end. The second description [<hi rend="italic">l</hi>] too applies in some degree; in this view, <quote>the moral norm is not morality, but deliverance,</quote> so that comedy is seen to be both radical and conservative. It may make the outsider, the man who does not fit into our society or its conventions, into a victim, exposing him or driving him out, like Dr. Pinch; and it may also expose the hollowness of a society’s pretensions by setting them against the exuberance of a figure like Dromio of Syracuse.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">These general considerations may help to illustrate the particular quality of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>. The play has farcical comedy, and it has fantasy, but it does more than merely provoke laughter, or release us temporarily from inhibitions and custom into a world as free as a child’s, affording delight and freshening us up. It also invites compassion, a measure of sympathy, and a deeper response to the disruption of social and family relationships which the action brings about. Our concern for the Antipholus twins, for Adriana and Luciana, and our sense of disorder are deepened in the context of suffering provided by the enveloping action. The comedy proves, after all, to be more than a temporary and hilarious abrogation of normality; it is, at the same time, a process in which the main characters are in some sense purged, before harmony and the responsibility of normal relationships are restored at the end. Adriana learns to overcome her jealousy, and accepts the reproof of the Abbess; her husband is punished for his anger and potential brutality by Doctor Pinch’s drastic treatment; and Antipholus of Syracuse is cured of his prejudices about Ephesus. Behind them stands Egeon, a prototype of the noble sufferer or victim in later plays [Antonio in <title level="m">MV</title>, Pericles].</quote></p>

<head>Identity</head>

<p>Loss of identity, a particularly 20th-c. anxiety, becomes an increasingly fertile topic; its psychoanalytic approaches are dealt with separately below, but the separation is difficult to keep clean.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ellg1939"><name type="app">Elliott</name></ref> (1939–40, p. 95): <quote>I think the underlying reason for [the play’s] success is the fact that Shakespeare was thoroughly penetrated by the comic horror, so to call it, implicit in the subject. Real horror attaches to the notion of the <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> identity of two human beings; as in Poe’s ghastly tale of a girl who turned out to be the re-embodiment of the mother who died in giving birth to her; and as in certain ancient legends of various lands, notably China. All normal persons (and especially Shakespeare) set so much store by human individuality that they shrink from the thought of its being submerged. And since the amusing, when intense, is nigh to the serious, there is something shuddery in the close resemblance of persons just when this appears to us intensely entertaining. I recall a school-teacher many years ago who found in her class at the beginning of the term two little girls who were remarkably, even weirdly, <quote>identical</quote> twins.&hellip;At the end of the first week the teacher exclaimed to us all with comic horror: <quote>These two are the same—how can I tell them apart?</quote> After a moment of dead silence a small boy (not I) piped out, <quote>Mary’s temper’s better’n Martha’s.</quote> The general laughter which ensued had in it a note of relief that was not exclusively comic. And <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> has a note of real weirdness just when its mirth is keenest.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1961"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1961, pp. 58–60): <quote>The idea of his [S.Antipholus’s] <quote>losing himself</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0204">204</ref>] is taken up in a profound sense, and couched in a fine image commensurate with its thematic importance. The theme of identity is here linked with those of relationship (dislocated or re-established), and of risk. To seek reunion with the lost members of the family, Antipholus is risking his identity; yet he must do so, for only if the full relationship is restored can he find content. And then, hints the image of one water-drop seeking another, the present individual identity will be lost, or transformed, in another way. It is to claim a sinking of identity in the marriage-relation, with the emergence of a new identity, where each is also the other, that Adriana uses the closely similar image in II.ii. In the play’s harmonic structure, while this soliloquy is thus recalled at that point, in its own place it recalls the situation of Egeon, who on virtually the same quest as Antipholus, has so risked his mortal identity that it is forfeit to the [<hi rend="italic">59</hi>] executioner. Antipholus’ fear that he is losing himself is full of comic irony. No sooner has he expressed it, than, with the entry of his brother’s Dromio, he begins to be the victim of the successive mistakes of identity to which his words are designed by Shakespeare as a prelude, and in the course of which he will come to wonder whether he is beside himself, and has lost himself indeed.</quote> Brooks lists the mistakes based on confused identity, then <quote>It is by mistaking appearance for reality that Antipholus and his brother’s Dromio misidentify one another. The threat to the very self involved in the confusion of appearance and reality is the thought most [<hi rend="italic">60</hi>] vividly conveyed in Antipholus’ second soliloquy [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0261" targetEnd="#tln_0271">261–71</ref>].&hellip;The lines [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0265" targetEnd="#tln_0266">265–6</ref>] seize the imagination of the audience at the deep level where the ancient dread of losing the self or soul is very much alive. They are highly characteristic of the imaginative Antipholus, develop the idea in his first soliloquy that his self is at hazard, and set the pattern for his interpretations of the strange experiences that befall him henceforward.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xliii ff.) works over the identity theme, beginning with the <quote>drop of water</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0204">199–204</ref>) speech, the fear of transformation on the part of S.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hung1962"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> (1962, p. 303): <quote>It is the threat of the loss of identity that draws forth the most powerful poetry in the play: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1788" targetEnd="#tln_1799">1788–99</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pel1"><name type="app">Jorgensen</name></ref> (ed. 1964, pp. 22–3): <quote part="I">Mistaken identity is in itself an additional blow to the individual ego. One is seldom pleased to find that he is constantly being taken for someone else—usually, of course, someone much less impressive. There are, however, several kinds of mistaken identity. This play employs the lowest. The two higher forms&hellip;are mistaking the true nature of another person and mistaking one’s own nature. Both lead to a re-examination of life and involve character growth. Exteriors are important only in so far as they lead to a realization of one’s true nature. Of these two higher forms there are only hints in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>. Antipholus of Syracuse asks a question that might have been all-important in a later comedy: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0608" targetEnd="#tln_0610">608–10</ref>].

How soon does one’s conception of oneself, the belief in one’s own identity, break down before lack of recognition on the part of others? How far do we need others in order to have an identity at all? Is one’s identity entirely dependent on the personal and social links and bonds, the ties of family, love, friendship and civic duty? In order that these questions might be tackled without in this case leading to madness and violent death, as they do in <title level="m">King Lear</title>, Shakespeare added the twin servants.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">71</hi>] <quote part="M">What seems to have happened in Shakespeare’s handling of the story is this.

The sense of alienation, that <foreign xml:lang="de" rend="italic">Verfremdungseffekt</foreign> so characteristic of Brecht and of the twentieth-century theater, is all the greater when our image of ourselves depends for its corroboration upon a settled context, and when we come to realize—what tragedy teaches us—that it is our destiny to be displaced.&hellip;[Quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0200">199–200</ref>.] Antipholus of Syracuse&hellip;realiz[es] that he is less likely to find a mother and a brother than to be irretrievably lost himself.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_vant1978"><name type="app">Van Laan</name></ref> (1978, pp. 21–6, 43–4, 179–80) devotes a chapter, <title level="a">Identity and Role,</title> using <title level="m">Err.</title> to show what it <quote>reveals about Shakespeare’s sense of dramatic character and of the relation between a character’s identity and role-playing. Identity is of course an important dramatic issue throughout Shakespeare, yet it is nowhere more explicitly so than in this play. Oddly enough, the play offers not one but two definitions of identity, the first perceivable through focusing upon action, the second through focusing on character.</quote></p>

<p>(1) Action. <quote>The most recurrent&hellip;action&hellip;is the attribution of identity to someone who does not correspond to it. Early on the misattributed identity is simply that of a second character with whom the first has been confused, but before long the process grows more complicated, and thus throughout most of the play the falsely attributed identity is a fiction even within the world of the play, a new creation, a bizarre composite of the actual identity of one character, cer&shy;[<hi rend="italic">22</hi>]tain statements and actions of another, and the wild imaginings of a third.</quote> Whatever the combination of this basic pattern may be, <quote part="I">the spectators are continually presented with a discrepancy between the projected identity and the character to whom it is attributed.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">What complicates this basic pattern is that, although the discrepancy is always obvious to the spectators and usually apparent to the mistaken character, it often carries no real weight in the action. Time and time again, it is the attributed rather than the actual identity that determines the experience of the character, whether he notes the discrepancy or not.</quote> When S. Antipholus beats E. Dromio in 2.1, the mistake <quote>is irrelevant as far as poor Dromio is concerned: the beating has been administered; in existence if not in essence, Dromio of Ephesus has become his Syracusan twin.</quote> Another example: E. Antipholus knows he is not the imposter in 3.1, but remains locked out. <quote>This complication, in which the mistaken character is made to undergo experiences appropriate to the identity imposed on him, combines well with the fictitiousness of most of the imposed identities. Identity <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">per se</foreign> begins to look like a kind of role that one might play as if one were an actor portraying the part of some fictional character.</quote></p>

<p>(2) Identity as a role, e.g., Dromio in 3.1 playing at being the porter at the gate (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0607">607</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0613">613</ref>) where <quote>Master, shall I be porter at the gate?</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0613">613</ref>) (p. 23) <quote part="I">suggests that in this world there is no real difference between being something and playing something.&hellip;[S.] Antipholus&hellip;responds in a similar fashion. He is bewildered by the presumptuous behaviour of these strange women and especially by their commands to himself and Dromio, but he decides to <quote>say as they say, and persever so</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0611">611</ref>]). He too, therefore, agrees to play a role, to take direction from others and speak the lines they expect from him; and, like Dromio, he is successful in playing his assigned part. He refuses to treat Adriana as a wife, for he instead vigorously woos Luciana, but this behaviour, rather than exposing the imposture, is interpreted by Adriana as merely the latest and the most outrageous example of her husband’s philandering.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Oddly enough, the characters’ attitudes towards their own identities further help to establish this notion of identity as role. When Dromio of Syracuse finds an alien identity imposed on him by Adriana and Luciana, he does not, even when he gets the chance, insist on the authenticity of his own; instead, he fears he has been <quote>transformed</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0590">590</ref>]).</quote> Antipholus thinks he has been transformed. He (p. 24) <quote>sees his identity, that which should be his most intrinsic possession, as perhaps no more an essential part of himself than a dramatic role is of an actor who performs it,</quote> commenting on <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0824" targetEnd="#tln_0829">824–9</ref>.</p>

<p>(P. 25): <quote part="I">It is&hellip;in the final scene&hellip;that Shakespeare most clearly establishes the overwhelming importance of external relationships in the composition of identity. Here all the characters are properly identified, but only in terms of their links with one another, that is, as husbands, wives, fathers, sons, mothers, masters, servants, and—most important of all—brothers. The celebration called for by Aemilia is properly a nativity feast because the central characters are truly reborn.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">26</hi>] <quote part="M">For Pinch and the Duke, identity is equivalent to a single role. For most of the others, however, it is a more complicated matter because in each case several roles are involved. Yet not even for these others is identity some kind of unified personality (<quote>character</quote> in the psychological sense) but rather the nexus of various social roles that they are given to play.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Any attempt to penetrate beneath this nexus in search of the <quote>essential man</quote> is doomed to failure. Antipholus of Syracuse mentions at one point his <quote>soul’s pure truth</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0824">824</ref>]), but it is an empty, undramatized cliché without any validity. Antipholus has no inner substance; apart from his ability to perform properly whichever of his roles the immediate situation seems to call for, or his capacity to express bewilderment in response to bewildering events, he is devoid of <quote>personality.</quote> The reason is obvious. Antipholus of Syracuse must lack inner substance because the play requires that he be interchangeable with his Ephesian twin.</quote></p>

<p>Role-playing is not thematic in <title level="m">Err</title>, but becomes so from <title level="m">Shr.</title> on (positing that <title level="m">Err.</title> is first in the comic, if not the entire, canon). (P. 43): <quote>One reason for the lack of explicitness in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is that its role-playing is primarily an unconscious activity. The characters cannot actually perceive the ubiquity of role-playing in themselves&hellip;because they engage in it only as a function of their familial and social ties or as a result of others having imposed alien identities on them. None of them indulges in a deliberate attempt to pass himself off as something [<hi rend="italic">44</hi>] he is not.</quote></p>

<p>The meaning of the loss of identity, how characters respond to the threat, is the stuff of the great tragedies. The loss is managed by having a familiar external reality change under one’s feet. (P. 179): <quote>This linking of identity loss with the sense of dislocated reality and madness indicates that Shakespeare already [in <title level="m">Err.</title>] conceives of the nexus of roles which form a character’s identity as the source of his bearings, the means by which he locates himself within and orders himself in relation to the wilderness of the universe.</quote> Characters <quote>must respond to the loss or threatened loss [of identity] in some decisive and appropriate way—again judging from both <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and the great tragedies, by going mad, resort&shy;[<hi rend="italic">180</hi>]ing to violence, finding new roles to play, or, perhaps, by some combination of all these expediencies.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_frem1981"><name type="app">French</name></ref> (1981, p. 81): <quote>At this point in his life [the very beginning of his writing career], Shakespeare believed that one’s identity is largely a matter of one’s place in the world.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_scom1982"><name type="app">Scott</name></ref> (1982, pp. 2–4): <quote>Egeon in the first scene is a pathetic old man, isolated in an alien land divorced from wife and children through the dictates of wealth and Fortune: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0040" targetEnd="#tln_0047">40–7</ref>]. [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] This incident was eventually to isolate Egeon from his wife and children so that now in Ephesus he has no will to live, his only wish being to know whether his family are still alive: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0140" targetEnd="#tln_0142">140–2</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0160" targetEnd="#tln_0161">160–1</ref>]. The <quote>procrastination</quote> of his death implies that Egeon has spent the last five years, at least, of his life in the despair of isolation, searching for his family, his roots which are his identity. It is this loss of self-identity not only for Egeon, but for all his relations which is to form the kernel of the play; a simple idea at first only proposed by the old man’s pathetic tale but soon stated explicitly as a theme, by Antipholus of Syracuse: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0204">199–204</ref>]. It is misleading to see this statement as an insight to Antipholus’s characterization. We are not watching a comedy dealing in such terms but rather a farce which negates characterization in favour of simple archetype. Antipholus’s speech therefore naturally becomes a clarification of Egeon’s opening [<hi rend="italic">4</hi>] statement.&hellip;Thus Egeon’s exposition is simply clarified by Antipholus before we are presented with the complexities of the variations, which in this case we call the <quote>errors</quote> on the theme of the loss of identity. We soon find therefore that the three principal characters, Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, and Adriana are comically portrayed as separated from any relationship with another person. All are searching, striving, enquiring and yet getting nowhere since there seem to be no answers.</quote> Such <quote>depiction of separation and utter loneliness has found expression in the farcical theatre of the absurd.</quote></p>

And yet names, and all language, have been revealed as generically susceptible to metamorphosis. To say <quote>I, sir, am Dromio</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1821">1821</ref>], is to announce and to undermine one’s identity at the same time, because our names uniquely mark us and yet do not mark us.&hellip;</quote></p>

Chronology therefore becomes an issue: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1911" targetEnd="#tln_1915">1911–15</ref>]. E. Dromio then rejects this motion of difference, bidding them instead to go out together. It seems a quixotic effort. A great deal of the play has gone to show that even minimal difference and boundary become crucial to human identity. At the moment of metamorphosis, when S. Dromio becomes E. Dromio or vice versa, one or both will temporarily cease to exist. Shakespeare has put such a case quite flamboyantly here, with two sets of twins. And though the re-naming of the christening feast will go far toward sorting out the <quote>sympathized one day’s error</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1887">1887</ref>], we will still recall that the sheerest linguistic thread maintained the margin of difference.

<p><quote part="F">The wandering Antipholus’s first moments onstage also suggest the potential doubleness of Ephesus, for even as he is told of its dangerousness for him, he accepts a bag of gold [it is, after all, his—see <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0170">170</ref>]—the gesture emblematic of the commercial exchanges at the heart of urban life. More importantly, by characterizing Ephesus as alternately welcoming and hostile, as home and alien city, Shakespeare associates the city with the closely related archetypal motifs of the pursuing double and of fraternal rivalry.&hellip;The relevance of such archetypes [e.g., Otto Rank, <title level="m">The Double</title>]—particularly the fraternal rivalry that we have already come to connect with the idea of the city—allows us to see how Shakespeare uses the farcical action of the doubled twins not only as a paradigm of personal self-fulfillment in family reunion, but also as a paradigm of the radical connectedness of social experience, an ideal relation of self and city which gets tested in the two later plays</quote> [i.e., <title level="m">MV</title>, <title level="m">MM</title>].

In a broad sense, all characters are asses; in their unrelenting unawareness of each other’s presence in Ephesus, they form an iconographic parade of ignorance assembled from the pages of Ripa and Valeriano.

He had broken away from his own wife and felt a strong impulse to justify the act on the stage. It could not be shown straightforwardly, of course. In the first place the poet was too blind with tears of self-pity to see the naked truth. Moreover he sensed that his wife did not hold a monopoly of the guilt in their disgrace. He had the intelligence and the courage to admit that he had contributed wrongs and miseries to the marriage; but his courage took the peculiar path of confessing his sins under the mask of comedy.</quote> Feldman sees the play as the product of Sh.’s guilty incestuous desires for his mother.</p>

The riddle of twins is widespread; the fact of two people indistinguishable by looks may cause anxiety, because of the ease with which the wrong twin might have sex with an unwitting wife, as Jupiter does with Alcmena in <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> and as <quote part="I">Adriana, dutiful wife though she is, narrowly escapes going to bed with the wrong Antipholus. And thus the case reveals itself as one&hellip;of potential incest.&hellip;It is easy enough to see moreover that in [<hi rend="italic">16</hi>] the triangular relationship the real Amphitryon plays the part of a staid husband, already past his best, while all the illicit intoxication, the daring, the youth of love is on the side of Jupiter. Thus the suggestion of incest which attaches to the triangle points to its great archetype.

<p>[<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] <quote part="M">[<title level="m">Amphitryon</title> and <title level="m">Err.</title>] are remarkable instances of the ambiguity of comedy.

<p><quote part="F">In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, the fun arises mostly from the fact that the pieces of the family puzzle, the elements of the solution, are all there, ready for use, in the same city of Ephesus.

Our real fear is lest the two [sets of twins] should happen to meet and thus, by inevitable recognition, spoil the game.</quote> The greatest hilarity surrounds the excluding of E.

(P. 18): <quote part="I">Whether we fear more that this should happen than that it should not is a debatable question and, perhaps, a matter of taste.

<p><quote part="F">But the real purpose of Shakespeare’s&hellip;comedy is not to offer a way out of ambiguity. It is much rather to face it. The escapes which they propose may well have mostly to do with their own obsessions. There is indeed in these escapes something curiously reminiscent of the terror inspired by the two tragic errors linked together in the Oedipus story: killing the father and marrying the mother. Which of the two sacrilegious deeds each dramatist found most unthinkable may be reflected in his attempt to turn the other alternative into a comic issue. But Shakespeare and Molière are at their comic best in the spirit which prompts them to laugh and make us laugh at our anxious fear of the great tragic doom.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_macw1978"><name type="app">MacCary</name></ref> (1978, pp. 528–34): <quote>If we were to formulate a kind of comedy which would fulfill the demands associated with the pre-oedipal period [the child before he has learned to channel all his libidinal energy into the pursuit of a woman who will take the place of his mother], it would have many of the aspects which critics find annoying in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>. The family would be more important than anyone outside the family, and the mother would be the most important member of the family. Security and happiness would be sought not in sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex but in reunion with or creation of a person like the person the protagonist would like to become, i.e., his alter ego, or, more correctly, his ideal ego. There would be an ambivalent attitude toward women in the play, because the young child (male) depends upon his mother for sustenance but fears being reincorporated by the mother. Such fears of the overwhelming mother might be expressed in terms of locked doors and bondage, but the positive nurturing mother would occasion concern with feasting and drinking. There might even be ambivalent situations, such as banquets arranged by threatening women, and ambivalent symbols, such as gold rings or chains, which suggest both attraction and restriction.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">237</hi>] <quote part="F">What is of chief importance in understanding farce, then, is the recognition that the plot’s aggression is punitive, and meaningfully so—a recognition in turn dependent upon the reconstruction of the characters’ [<hi rend="italic">238</hi>] disguised, denied transgressions.</quote></p>

<p>Turning to <title level="m">Err.</title>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_freb1980b"><name type="app">Freedman</name></ref> begins an analysis that depends on three assertions that are either wrong or unproven. First, <quote>There has been no successful attempt to uncover a method to the mad confusion of the twins’ identities in the main plot or a reason for its envelopment by a frame plot containing their father’s woes.

Second, Egeon’s thousand mark ransom or fine is everywhere described as a <quote>debt</quote> (p. 239): <quote>Egeon’s doom is also the result of an inability to pay a debt</quote> (see also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_freb1980a"><name type="app">Freedman</name></ref>, <title level="a">Egeon’s Debt,</title> 1980); her whole analysis depends on this notion. But a debt is <quote>anything&hellip;which one person is under an obligation to pay or render to another</quote> (<title level="m">OED</title>, 1) and an obligation is <quote>an agreement&hellip;whereby a person&hellip;become[s] bound to the payment of a sum of money</quote> (<rs type="oed"><title level="m">OED</title>, 2 <hi rend="italic">Law</hi></rs>); to call Egeon’s fine or ransom anything like an <quote>agreement,</quote> without at least arguing for the definition, torments the language too much, even though we speak, probably too loosely, of a criminal’s <quote>paying a debt to society.</quote> Third (p. 240), <quote>The highlight of Egeon’s story is equally a failure to return home [equal to E. Antipholus’s], which, while it is melodramatically presented to us as the result of <quote>cruel fate</quote> [there is no such phrase in the play, but see <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0143" targetEnd="#tln_0144">143–4</ref>], is not the first such incident in his biography. It is, however, the one instance in which Egeon’s separation from his spouse is attributed to external forces, earlier separations being attributed once to business ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0045" targetEnd="#tln_0046">45–6</ref>]), and once, most significantly, to personal preference ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0062" targetEnd="#tln_0064">62–4</ref>]).</quote> Freedman must misread <quote>My wife, not meanely prowd of two such boyes, Made daily motions for our home returne: Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too soone we came aboord,</quote> where there is no separation in <quote>our home returne</quote> and no personal preference save not wanting to set sail as a family in <quote>Vnwilling I agreed</quote>; her citation seems not to include <quote>alas&hellip;aboord.</quote></p>

<p>Less problematic is her use of <hi rend="italic">debt</hi> to describe marital relations; the uncited origin of the metaphor is <rs type="bibleref">1 Cor. 7:3</rs>, which thereafter becomes almost universally employed by writers on Christian marriage; but the source might be acknowledged since it is central to her thesis. With these objections in mind, we may follow her essay.</p>

<p>(P. 239): <quote>Presented with a knockabout farce obsessed with the anguish and punishment of unpaid debts, yet notably devoid of any significant and valid debt, we are led to consider the hypothesis that the play is censoring or dislocating the debt’s significance and validity; further, that it is this censoring activity which enables the play of otherwise unacceptable aggressive content associated with the debt. More simply, the hypothesis is that the play’s harsh confrontation and punishment of unpaid debts is only made acceptable, indeed humorous, by disguising and dislocating its content and validity. Our strategy would then be to seek possible points of dislocation or displacement in the pattern of debts that might lead to the recovery of meaning.</quote></p>

<p>On the basis of the centrality of Egeon’s debt, the play works out patterns of (p. 238) <quote part="I">crime-punishment-forgiveness and debt-payment-redemption.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">240</hi>] <quote part="F">Somehow, the twins’ confrontation of mistaken debts, as well as their mistaken fulfillment of debts, is a means of paying a real debt, of working out Egeon’s redemption. The denial of the significance of the twins’ confrontation of debts is thus invalidated. Furthermore, were the twins not confronting Egeon’s actual debt, this advance from his bondage to his freedom would be unwarranted. We are thus left with the thesis that the validity of the twins’ debt is to be found in Egeon’s situation; perhaps the meaningful content of Egeon’s debt and the transgression associated with it may be found in the twins’ situation.</quote></p>

<p>Egeon’s real transgression was his desire to be separated from his wife—<quote>his own guilty wish for independence</quote>—which accounts for his eighteen-year delay in setting out to find her and his (p. 241) <quote part="I">passive acceptance of a decidedly obscure punishment.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Finally, the fact that Egeon’s initial situation couples indebtedness with separation from others, whereas his release from debt results in his reunion with his wife, also suggests that his debt is indeed marital rather than monetary. Thus there is a sense in which the marital debt is both significant and valid and provides a meaningful link between the frame plot and the main plot. Since the monetary debts contracted do not fulfill this condition, it seems justified to consider that they are a disguised expression of the marital debt and that the meaningful content of Egeon’s debt is disclosed in the marital debts that his sons confront.</quote></p>

<p>The twins are symbolic functions of two sides of Egeon. (P. 242): <quote part="I">Antipholus of Ephesus is quite literally the part of Egeon that has remained lost with his wife since the storm finally separated the couple; Antipholus of Syracuse is that part of Egeon that has remained with him. Antipholus of Ephesus is married to a demanding wife, as his father was long ago, while Antipholus of Syracuse is a bachelor, as Egeon is now.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The play, then, is not simply about the payment of debts or the physical division and reunion of a family, but about the psychic division and integration of a personality, the reintegration of a long-denied part of oneself through psychological payment as well. That the path to the integration of Egeon’s personality should involve the <quote>mistaken</quote> identification of single and married twins with each other may seem immediately less problematic. That the <quote>miraculous</quote> recovery of Egeon’s past marital [<hi rend="italic">243</hi>] identity depends upon the <quote>mistaken</quote> confrontation of marital debts may also seem more logical. The farcical misunderstandings of identity, the absurd series of debts directed at the <quote>wrong</quote> man, are not as nonsensical as they first appear. The two actions are one; the errors no errors at all.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_freb1980a"><name type="app">Freedman</name></ref> (<title level="a">Egeon’s Debt,</title> 1980) repeats much of the preceding essay. One problem in this essay is the paucity of quotation, which leads to the reader’s not always recognizing the context (p. 371): <quote>Antipholus of Syracuse no sooner enters Ephesus than he is led by the device of mistaken identities to believe he has lost all his money. Having just learned of the precarious state of Syracusans in Ephesus, Antipholus of Syracuse fears that he will incur the debt which, unknown to him, his father has contracted. His financial situation is no sooner clarified than he is mistakenly accused of marital neglect by his sister-in-law, Adriana, who claims of him the obligations of husband to wife. The substitution of marital for monetary indebtedness is significant; it leads to the first possibility of redemption in the play. Antipholus of Syracuse follows Adriana to his brother’s home, where he is promised a full dinner and Adriana’s forgiveness.</quote> This is a plausible account of parts of 1.2 and 2.2, but one looks in vain for S. Antipholus’s fear that he will likewise incur the <quote>debt</quote> that has been assessed Egeon (indeed, his failure to wonder about the <hi rend="italic">Syracusian</hi> Marchant at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0165">165</ref> is odd) or for Adriana’s promise of <quote>forgiveness,</quote> though it is implied in <quote>shrive you</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0604">604</ref>).

Here, and in the romances as well, such externally enforced family separation could dramatize the frequent separation of Elizabethan families by death and standard child-rearing practices. Feeling separation as rejection probably alternated with feeling it as beyond human control like tempest and shipwreck. The reticence that the Antipholus brothers keep in their reunion—they never speak directly to each other—may show that the ideal of emotional control continues its claims even at the happy ending. At the corresponding point, the Menaechmi twins&hellip;speak to each other with feeling, and we might expect even more eloquence at the father-son reunion not found in the source, but we do not get it. This inarticulacy allows the actors to fill in with gestures, of course, and the audience with imagination; nevertheless it is interesting that it is the mother who has almost all the words of joy at the resolution, and that her imagery turns on childbirth [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1890" targetEnd="#tln_1892">1890–2</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adej1985"><name type="app">Adelman</name></ref> (1985, pp. 73–6, 93–5) is concerned <quote part="I">with a male identity that locates itself via bonding with another man and recognizes in women a disturbance to the bond and to the identity so constituted.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">We ordinarily think of Shakespearean comedy as characterized by its ending in a marriage, or at least in the promise of a marriage, that will resolve the tensions of the plot as it marks the passing of the hero and heroine from childlike dependence on their old family unit to the establishment of new adult identities in the formation of a new family unit.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">74</hi>] <quote part="M">In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, marriage is so incidental to the prime business of the play that the normally talkative Luciana is allowed no response to Antipholus of Syracuse’s rather off-hand marriage proposal at the play’s end; its part in the joyful resolution is insignificant in comparison with the reunion of the broken family. Furthermore, the play’s rather meager promise of a happy marriage for one twin is more than balanced by its full demonstration of the unharmonious marriage of the other twin.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">75</hi>] <quote part="M">The love plot of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> cannot be sorted out until Antipholus of Syracuse finds out in the most literal way who he isn’t.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">For despite the implicit assertion of the comic pattern that sees conflict in generational terms, we do not move directly from family bonds to marriage without an intervening period in which our friendships with same-sex friends help us to establish our independent identities; and marriage is notoriously disruptive of these friendships and sometimes of the identities based on them. This double movement is perfectly embodied in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and <title level="m">The Two Gentle&shy;<hi rend="clear">[</hi><hi rend="italic">76</hi><hi rend="clear">]</hi>men of Verona</title>: taken together, they begin to suggest the full complexity of the pattern in which male identity is achieved by merger with a mirror self and then threatened by women.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M"><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> explores the first part of this pattern almost diagrammatically. Antipholus of Syracuse tells us that he loses himself in his quest to find his mother and brother ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0204">204</ref>]); but the action of the play argues that he can find himself only by so losing himself. In the course of the play, he is robbed of those external assurances by which identity is normally confirmed and begins to doubt even the self-identification of his own memory; his identity is assured only at the unravelling that occurs when he and his twin are finally face to face. His identity at this moment is contingent upon himself in a mirroring other, a process that Dromio of Ephesus makes clear when he says to his own twin, [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1909" targetEnd="#tln_1910">1909–10</ref>]. Identity here develops precisely out of the tension between self and other, only in the presence of the mirroring twin who is both self and other. </quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">But such an identity borders perilously on fusion.&hellip;The comedy depends throughout on just such a tension [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0200">199–200</ref>] between separation and fusion, so that we are always struggling to see which twin is which as we unravel the plot. In fact the end of the play emphasizes the process by which identity is created out of a state of undifferentiated fusion. Everyone on stage assumes for a dizzying moment that the two Antipholuses are in fact one—<quote>which is the natural man, / And which the spirit</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1818" targetEnd="#tln_1819">1818–19</ref>])—and the remaining action discovers who is who only by a sometimes tedious insistence on the separateness of events, in effect separating out the identities from the fused mirror-images by detailing what has happened to whom. This insistence is unnecessary for the audience, who already knows the plot, but apparently necessary for the fantasy about identity embedded here: for the recounting of events already familiar to the audience seems to ward off the danger that the twins, who discover themselves in the mirror relationship, will simply fuse. If <title level="m">Comedy</title> is thus about the tenuousness of identity, it leaves us with a radical image of the frail arena of the self: for the twins must be separated out from one another to know who they are; and yet they can know who they are only by seeing themselves mirrored in one another.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">93</hi>] <quote part="M">In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>&hellip;the recovery of male bonds is suggestively associated with the return of the mother, as though the two are necessarily simultaneous, or at bottom one. The simultaneity of this recovery is I think behind Shakespeare’s rather odd impulse to join the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> with the story of Apollonius of Tyre.&hellip;At the start, Antipholus of Syracuse claims to be searching for both brother and mother, and although the search for the mother is forgotten&hellip;her return in the surprise ending perfectly satisfies the longings suggested by Antipholus’s initial description of the hopelessness of his search [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0204">199–204</ref>].&hellip;From the point of view of a drop of water, it presumably does not much matter whether one fuses with another drop or with an ocean: either failing to find or finding entails loss of self.&hellip;Antipholus’s logic works to suggest that finding the drop should forestall the larger fusion; but the metaphor itself belies this logic.&hellip;For the search to find oneself in brother and mother is also a search for fusion in which the self will be lost.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">We may begin to understand the force of this fusion both feared and [<hi rend="italic">94</hi>] desired if we locate Antipholus’s metaphoric speech in its imagined point of literal embodiment in the play. The initial description of the splitting of each pair of twins, and of the parents, during their sea voyage gives us a cataclysmic image of oceanic <quote>divorce</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0107">107</ref>]) that seems clearly the emotional foundation for Antipholus’s metaphor of the self confounded in the ocean. But at the same time, this cataclysmic image allows us to understand the desire for fusion inherent in Antipholus’s watery metaphor. For the sea-splitting is in part a re-imagining of the divorce of birth itself, a fearful birth felt not as individuation but as incompletion.&hellip;Antipholus’s desire to find his twin—his desire for the fusion of one drop with another—is the desire to undo the violent sea-splittings that initiate the wanderings, the errors, of the play. In that sense, the starting point for the play’s insistence on the search for the split-off mirror self is the radical sense of separation from the mother.&hellip;Hence the power of Antipholus’s desire for fusion and the plot-magic by which the recovery of the twin-self dissolves into the recovery of the mother. Hence too the utter appropriateness with which the Abbess redefines birth itself by associating the recovery of her children, with their birth, with the long-awaited parturition: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1890" targetEnd="#tln_1892">1890–2</ref>].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The condensation in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> of the search for the mirroring self and the search for the mother may allow us to understand&hellip;the force of male bonding in Shakespeare’s works.&hellip;For the mirror relationship is&hellip;transitional: it allows for a new sense of self based on separateness from the mother while maintaining the fluidity of the boundaries between self and other characteristic of that first relationship. In that sense it offers protection against engulfment by the mother while allowing for the comforts of the union. Both the desire for fusion and the protection offered by the mirror relationship are perfectly captured by the illogic of Antipholus’s metaphor of the drops and the ocean: in his imagination, fusion with the other identical drop will somehow prevent fusion with the mother-ocean. For the male bond protects against total fusion with the mother by replicating the early mother-child relationship with a difference—replicating it not in its choice of object but [<hi rend="italic">95</hi>] in its choice of mode: not by choosing a woman who can then be imaginatively linked with the mother, as in <title level="m">Troilus and Cressida</title> or <title level="m">Othello</title>, but by choosing a twin-self with whom one can be fused.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kahc1980"><name type="app">Kahn</name></ref> (1980, pp. 217–25): <quote part="I">Shakespeare rarely portrays masculine selfhood without suggesting a filial context for it.&hellip;It goes without saying that Shakespeare depicts all his women characters as sisters, daughters, wives, or mothers.&hellip;Yet, at the same time, an intense ambivalence toward the family runs through Shakespeare’s works, taking the familiar shape of conflicts between inheritance and individuality and between autonomy and relatedness.&hellip;Characters must break out of their families in order to grow up, and when they have founded families of their own, they must learn both to accept and then to let go of their children.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">I will set the Shakespearean quest for masculine selfhood in the context of the family and the life cycle. From the beginning of his career to the end, Shakespeare sought a dramatic and psychological strategy for dealing not only with our common ambivalence toward our families but specifically with the male passage from being a son to being a father. He found it through the romance, in one of its [<hi rend="italic">218</hi>] typical patterns of action that I shall call <quote>the providential tempest.</quote> [<title level="m">Err.</title>, <title level="m">TN</title>, <title level="m">Per.</title>, <title level="m">WT</title>, <title level="m">Tmp.</title>] all&hellip;depict the separation of family members in a literal or metaphorical tempest; the resulting sorrow and confusion; and the ultimate reunion of the family, with a renewed sense of identity or rebirth for its members. This pattern is that of a journey, and it suggests a passage through time as well as through space—the individual’s passage from emotional residence within the family to independence and adulthood. As depicted&hellip;the tempest and shipwreck initiating the main action represent the violence, confusion, and even terror of passing from one stage of life to the next, the feeling of being estranged from a familiar world and sense of self without another to hang onto.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Reading these five plays as a group, we watch a process of identity formation highlighted in two significantly related crises: that of the youth emerging from the family, more than a child but still not a man, and that of the father who has not yet fully accepted his fatherhood.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kahc1980"><name type="app">Kahn</name></ref> cites Erik Erikson on identity formation, when in adolescence the <quote>instinctual and social pressures for intimacy with the opposite sex</quote> and pressures to form a stable line of work and way of life produce a crisis, forcing the individual back into the family, <quote>into the identifications of the early, preoedipal stage of ego building. In effect, the adolescent reexperiences separation and individuation, but not solely through his mother.</quote></p>

<p>She also refers to Peter Blos, who says that adolescence is characterized by mourning for the loss of the (p. 219) <quote>strongest love [the adolescent] has known thus far, his love for his parents.</quote> In his mourning, he <quote>identifies with them, or one of them. But he does this indirectly, by merging narcissistically with persons who can mirror him as that parent once did. In effect, he recapitulates the symbiotic merger with the mother preceding individuation,</quote> leading in stages to <quote>the search for a heterosexual object [characterized] by an overwhelming hunger for a love object of the same sex, in which the real identity of the object, the parent of the same sex, is denied. Whether it is positive or negative, identification with this same-sex object is necessary, as part of the mourning process, before heterosexual love can exist. It is this process of mourning the loss of the parent by identification, and finding a new object of love after working through the identification, that <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and <title level="m">Twelfth Night</title> depict.</quote></p>

<p>Further points she makes: Psychoanalytic discussions of doubling are indebted to Freud and Rank. For Freud the double is (p. 220) <quote part="I"><quote>uncanny,</quote> a mental representation of something familiar and homelike but [also] secret, strange, and sinful—a representation&hellip;of our earliest sexual feeling and wishes with regard to our parents, which we later perceive as guilty, repress, and hide.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">221</hi>] <quote part="F">Freud and Rank also stress the double’s power to bind the hero to his oedipal past in another way. The double&hellip;is a potential death bringer, a projection of the castrating oedipal father, while at the same time it represents the hero’s beloved, narcissistically overestimated self. The double makes the hero’s life a torment, but the hero’s life also depends on the double’s existence.</quote></p>

<p>In <title level="m">Err.</title> the twin preserves a link with the past but also helps the other twin find a mate and so make a break. S. Antipholus seeks his brother, grieving for the loss, but through the mistaken identity finds Luciana.</p>

<p><quote>But in their searching and grieving, Antipholus S. and Viola are both regressing to the earliest stage of identity formation: identification with one perceived as being the same as oneself.</quote></p>

Antipholus.) Luciana (p. 223) <quote>would drown him, but she will rescue him, save him. Metaphorically, she will save him from that obliteration of self, that inauthentic metamorphosis into another person, which her sister promised: [<hi rend="italic">224</hi>] [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0832" targetEnd="#tln_0836">832–6</ref>].</quote> Likewise with S.

<p>Possession by spirits is the third metaphor for the loss of ego identity. Dr. Pinch’s exorcisms are in vain. <quote>The real deliverance from the bonds of error is by angelic power. Pauline word play runs through the scenes focusing on Antipholus E.’s arrest; mistakenly and to no avail, he seeks deliverance from the sargeant’s bonds with the coins—angels—which will pay his debt [she refers to <rs type="bibleref">Acts 12</rs>]. These echoes of Paul’s miraculous deliverance from prison prepare us for the denouement at the abbey, wherein the evil powers of Lapland sorcerers and Circe’s cup show themselves to be providence in disguise.</quote></p>

<p>Emphasis on time shows the <quote>development of identity as process rather than a fixed state.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">225</hi>] Emilia’s final lines firmly link this sense of time with a sense of identity as growth in time—the serious and realistic theme underlying the farce: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1890" targetEnd="#tln_1892">1890–2</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berr1985"><name type="app">Berry</name></ref>’s (1985, pp. 34–43) is a Jungian reading: <quote part="I">[<title level="m">Err.</title>] is rooted in the collective subconscious, and archetypes of enduring power are presented. The plot itself is a playful rendering of the hostile brother motif.&hellip;Here, [<hi rend="italic">35</hi>] the brothers are unwitting not hostile; it is only through ignorance that Antipholus of Syracuse intrudes upon his brother’s domain. The Syracusan appears, archetypally, to be the <quote>younger</quote> brother; he is defensive, apprehensive, easily daunted (but luckier, for all that).&hellip;The <quote>elder</quote> brother is passionate, overbearing, a fighter. This mutuality of temperament is a part of the psychic integration of the play. Then again, Luciana provides perhaps the clearest statement in Shakespeare of the anima archetype. [Quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0850" targetEnd="#tln_0853">850–3</ref>.] She, for Antipholus, is <quote>the embodiment of this omnipresent and ageless image &lt;of woman&gt; which corresponds to the deepest reality in man</quote> [quoting Jung, <title level="m">Aion</title>]. The final transformation of the anima is the Abbess, who also combines the functions of Great Mother and Wise Old Man.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">37</hi>] <quote part="F"><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is organized along two lines of psychic advance. One is that of erotic promise, unbelievable good fortune, discovered identity, the fulfilment of all one’s desires. The other is that of loss, shattered identity, pain. The first line is stronger, and its triumph never really in doubt. The second is always present, often uppermost, at all times shadowing the experience of cast and audience.

See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0727-01">727</ref> on whether this is certainly bawdry. The audience, he says, believes that the sex has occurred, despite his quoting of Adriana’s parting <quote>Come sister, <hi rend="italic">Dromio</hi> play the Porter well</quote> [which might add exhibitionism and voyeurism to the proceedings]. E. Antipholus likewise supposes that he has been cuckolded, hence makes plans for (p. 40) <quote>a sexual revenge</quote> with the Courtesan, depending on <hi rend="italic">Ile knocke else-where, to see if they’ll disdaine me</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0782">782</ref>): <quote part="I"><quote>Knocking</quote> is standard slang for sexual entry. But above all, the double-entendres and bawdry of the text stem from the stage symbolism itself: the house, perceived from earliest times as the coding for woman, and the knocking at the gates, the male attempts at entry. The symbolism is the more charged if the nature of the inner action is considered. What is held before the audience as a <hi rend="italic">theatrical</hi> possibility is incest.&hellip;Here in III.i, at the midpoint of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, incest is the compelling fantasy which is held before the audience as a likely reality.

<p>She reads the play in various ways—New Critical, deconstructionist, and so on—to show how for every explanation there is a counterexplanation that exposes the inadequacy of the reader as well as the uncertainty of the play. Her denial that anyone has been able to find a way to unify the play (how can the Egeon plot and the mistakes plot be harmonized, as they must be if the play is to be honored as more than a farce?) means only that she is not satisfied by earlier successes.

<p>She observes that Adriana is deprived of female subjectivity by being rebuked for her assertiveness by both Luciana and Aemilia. (P. 224): <quote>The subtexts&hellip;combine the play’s dual interest in the chaste mother of the nuclear family and the controlling framework of male narcissism—a shaping projection of the self based on the model of the male body that organizes its own version of loving sameness as the generous sharing of <quote>him selfe.</quote> The play’s ordering of marital relations revolves around subtexts that insist on female chastity [Aemilia’s becoming a nun] and on a wife’s meriting esteem as part of <quote>one flesh</quote> only if she is obedient to her husband’s <quote>self</quote> and body. It is in the context of this symmetrical, shaping masculine self-love that I [<hi rend="italic">225</hi>] would situate the language of the final scene: such a <quote>self</quote> requires a mother-turned-nun who inhabits and is herself a special place, a <quote>sanctuary</quote> where errant identity stops wandering or running about.&hellip;But she can become this guarantor or sanctuary for a speaking male identity only by being purged of any taint of sexuality.</quote></p>

<p>Modern readers may be puzzled as to why the question of incest appears at all, since sleeping with one’s brother’s wife has long since lost its taboo, though not its status as adultery. The <title level="m">OED</title> definition, <quote>The crime of sexual intercourse or cohabitation within the degrees within which marriage is prohibited,</quote> has as its last citation one dated 1868, and the phrase <quote>within the degrees</quote> blurs the old canon law statements of degrees of consanguinity and of affinity (relation by marriage). Canon law in Sh.’s day, and for long thereafter, prohibited a man’s <hi rend="italic">marrying</hi> his deceased (or divorced) brother’s wife; thus by definition S. Antipholus commits incest if he has intercourse with Adriana. This prohibition is based on <rs type="bibleref">Lev. 18</rs>, which forbids intercourse outside of marriage in this relationship. A Table of Prohibited Degrees was published in 1563 by Archbishop Parker and became Canon 99 in 1603, which specifically says that such marriages are <quote>incestuous.</quote> See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0651-01">651–745</ref>.</p>

In this family lie together the strange contrasts of domestic love and a roving spirit; these produce alternate happiness and misfortune, and occasion troubles and quarrels, in spite of inner congeniality of soul and family attachment, and estrangement and perplexity in spite of outward similarity.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">189</hi>] The inducement for this journey [Æmilia’s joining Egeon], the poet has left as a matter of conjecture; only so far has he indicated, that if a loving, it was also a wilful step.&hellip;Was it the result of suspicion and jealousy&hellip;?

<p>[<hi rend="italic">102</hi>] <quote part="F">Unity, in Puritan eyes, conferred on man and wife an equal division of labour.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jarl1983"><name type="app">Jardine</name></ref> (1983, pp. 44 ff.) incorrectly describes the midday lock-out scene (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0651-01">651–745</ref>) and continues, <quote>[E.

The audience’s reactions to Adriana’s pro&shy;[<hi rend="italic">45</hi>]testation at her ill-treatment can only&hellip;be hilarity; it is all so appalling, so much like a travesty of ordinary domestic relations that the speeches become set pieces for a male audience’s amusement: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0505" targetEnd="#tln_0523">505–23</ref>]. Adriana’s husband is in fact estranged from her; does, in fact, look more kindly on his mistress than on her; does tear himself from her. But the man to whom this speech is addressed is not in fact her husband. And what follows underscores the heavy irony that, because Adriana so dutifully pursues matrimonial accord in the face of all her <quote>husband’s</quote> negative efforts, she finds herself currently, unbeknownst to herself but to the amusement of the audience, hotly pursuing an adulterous relationship.</quote></p>

<p>Of Luciana’s counseling clandestine adultery (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0787" targetEnd="#tln_0801">787–801</ref>) (p. 46): <quote part="I">Antipholus is here being upright in the face of immense provocation (Adriana would have had him seduce her <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">qua</foreign> husband in the previous scene).

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_para1984"><name type="app">Parten</name></ref> (1984, pp. 11–12), considering whether men could be held as culpable as women in acts of adultery, says that a man was adulterous only if he had sex with another man’s wife. Puritan writers were sympathetic to equal standards, focusing chiefly on <rs type="bibleref">1 Cor. 7:4</rs>: <quote part="I">The power that Paul grants the wife over the body of her husband, his emphasis on the teaching that man and wife are one flesh and his stern condemnation of the body-polluting sin of harlotry, are taken together to provide the Biblical foundations for Elizabethan and Jacobean arguments against considering a husband’s adultery a less serious sin than a wife’s.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Shakespeare puts the argument derived from Pauline teaching to use the first time he presents the image of a wife protesting her husband’s infidelities. Adriana&hellip;complains to the man she supposes to be her husband that his sexual crimes have in turn contaminated her: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0535" targetEnd="#tln_0539">535–9</ref>]. Here, arguably, Adriana is on firm doctrinal ground. But her reproachful tirade also contains a detailed portrait of the way in which a husband might be expected to react to the news of his wife’s adultery: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0525" targetEnd="#tln_0532">525–32</ref>]. Her implication, clearly, is that the wife of an adulterer is entitled to experience some measure of the typical wronged husband’s outrage. As indirect and as limited in scope as is this endorsement of sexual parity, it is nonetheless part of the play’s larger portrait of Adriana as a woman on the verge of falling into the heresy of rejecting the divine law of sexual subordination. Her sister Luciana, a contrasting proponent of sweet reason and orthodox belief, must listen to Adriana querulously ask why men’s liberty should be more than women’s, and [listen as]&hellip;her good counsel is rejected contemptuously: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0288">288</ref>]. The last point Adriana [<hi rend="italic">12</hi>] raises, in her efforts to seduce Luciana into admitting that there are limits to the amount of wifely submission that a woman should be willing to exhibit, is the crucial question of whether she would endure her husband’s adultery: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0304">304</ref>]. Luciana&hellip;gives the response that is the ultimate guarantee of her freedom from her sister’s taint: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0305">305</ref>].</quote></p>

<p>That is, Adriana’s insistence on sexual equality is <quote>tainted.</quote> <quote>The wife who protests her husband’s adultery and who pairs that protest with an indirect or direct argument that she be considered her husband’s equal positions herself very near the social margin that divides the permitted from the prohibited.&hellip;The wife who takes this approach [of equality] may be seen as deluded, even dangerous—but the test she fails to pass is conceded to be the ultimate trial of her feminine submissiveness. In Shakespeare’s drama, which is shaped by [this view], the wife who&hellip;resists the temptation to question the double standard or to criticize her husband, has given the extreme proof of her worth as a wife.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ranm1987"><name type="app">Ranald</name></ref> (1987, pp. 112 ff.), after reviewing the literature and statutes that subject wives to husbands in terms of property ownership, sexual fidelity, and so on, says, <quote part="I">It is hard to believe that English women, particularly married women, were considered to possess a freedom of conduct unique in Western Europe. Shakespeare&hellip;obviously understood the problems encountered by women as a result of their required subordination in marriage and in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> he bases the subplot on some of them. At the same time he establishes his own pattern for marriage comedies. A matrimonial relationship is challenged by an independent woman (perhaps a shrew); problems ensue, with adultery sometimes alleged; and finally a resolution is reached. The woman usually accommodates her outward conduct to that of the man, but in also asserting her love, she shows such freedom of spirit that roles and attitudes are redefined in a marriage that is evolving towards mutuality and companionship. The husband is no longer foolish or tyrannous, the wife no longer shrewish, and the laws of fidelity and chastity are upheld.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">That Shakespeare intended the subplot&hellip;to be more than mere contrast&hellip;is obvious</quote> from his setting the play in Ephesus, with Eph.’s exhortation to wifely obedience. <quote>This biblical resonance is increased by the deliberate patterning of the debate between Adriana and Luciana after the <quote>Conjugium,</quote> one of the colloquies of Erasmus which Shakespeare may well have studied in school. In Erasmus, Xantippe is the archetypal shrew and Eulalia, the wife who speaks well of matrimony. She [<hi rend="italic">113</hi>] preaches that the wife should be the looking glass of her husband&hellip;showing forbearance, even if the husband takes a mistress.</quote> She rehearses the debate and other plot elements.</p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">116</hi>] <quote>The discovery that the reprehending Abbess is Adriana’s mother-in-law is more than a stock joke; it is also an ironic and amusing reference to the Erasmian colloquy. There Xantippe is brought to accept her wifely duties and practice patience only when Eulalia forces her to the realization that both her step-mother and her mother-in-law would be most gratified to see the couple separate. Thus in Erasmus, the redefinition of the wife’s role comes from an external influence, whereas in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> it represents an internal development. Even in this early comedy Shakespeare is treating the shrew with some humanity.&hellip;Both Adriana and Luciana have developed in the course of the play—something unusual in a farce—and both have learned something of the <foreign xml:lang="de" rend="italic">realpolitik</foreign> of marriage.&hellip;At the conclusion of the play Adriana has certainly not gained the mastery, though she does now have something with which to upbraid her husband, while he does not. What is important is that her shrewishness has been revealed as a reaction to the frustration of those deprived of legitimate liberty.&hellip;Adriana has shown her mettle and now accepts her wifely duties with love.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sins1988"><name type="app">Singh</name></ref> (1988, p. 47), quoting <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1516" targetEnd="#tln_1521">1516–21</ref>: <quote>The moral seems to be clear: if the husband errs, the wife should accept it.&hellip;The important point&hellip;is that most Elizabethans would have agreed with the Abbess and recognised that wives should not too much mind the sexual lapses on the part of their husbands though they themselves should lead totally chaste and unblemished lives.</quote> He scorns the double standard.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wolp1994"><name type="app">Wolfensperger</name></ref> (1994, p. 29): On the surface of the debate it seems that Luciana does no more than speak one orthodoxy, that of female submissiveness in marriage, and Adriana argues for another, one that opposes the double standard of morality and the analogy between husband-wife and master-servant. But he studies <quote>the comedy’s external system of communication</quote> that guides our response. <quote>What we are faced with&hellip;is a whole system of interdependent delicate balances, or labile equilibriums, on virtually every level of the scene. The <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">débat</foreign> resembles a verbal duel, in which both sides can score points, but which ultimately ends in a draw.

<p xml:id="para_0049">Other critics discuss the Ephesians’ marriage in more general ways. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broj1957"><name type="app">Brown</name></ref> (1957, pp. 54–6): <quote part="I">Following the clues of the sonnets and <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title>, the ideal of love’s wealth may be seen to inform the very earliest comedies. <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is, in the main, an intrigue comedy which aims at making a certain number of characters look ridiculous; it deals, therefore, not with the joy of giving in love, but with the follies and evils of possessiveness. Adriana’s idea of love is to try to maintain a hold over her husband; the liberty of his actions galls her and she demands her rights. As part of this plan, she obtains the promise of a gold chain. Instead of the <quote>willing loan</quote> of <quote>free</quote> agents, Adriana sees love as a system of promises, duties and bonds. Even at her most submissive, when she cajoles her husband’s twin&hellip;to come home as her husband, she harps upon rights and possessions: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0567" targetEnd="#tln_0572">567–72</ref>].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">55</hi>] <quote part="M">This kind of love is further defined by contrasted loves, that of Antipholus of Syracuse who offers himself to Luciana unasked, and for whom giving is its own reward: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0834" targetEnd="#tln_0838">834–8</ref>] or that of Luce who deals only in claims and possessions: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0872" targetEnd="#tln_0879">872–9</ref>]. This is the level of merely possessive love; and the fact is driven home by bringing these three loves together in one brief scene.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">There are further contrasts in the juxtaposition of misunderstandings about love and misunderstandings about the possession of servants, a gold chain, and a bag of ducats. For the like of Adriana there is little difference between them; so when the Goldsmith asks for his money on the strength of a bond, Antipholus of Ephesus in his refusal likens the confusion to Adriana’s sort of marriage: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1034" targetEnd="#tln_1037">1034–7</ref>]. [<hi rend="italic">56</hi>] But there is one difference between the two kinds of misunderstandings: those between masters and men, and merchant and purchaser are occasioned solely by confused identities&hellip;but Adriana’s misunderstandings, her claims of rights and wrongs, ante-date any mistaken identity. The merchants treat their possessions naturally as best they may, Adriana treats hers unnaturally—her merchandise requires the use of love’s wealth in which giving is more important than taking or keeping.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broc1960"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1960, pp. 353, 355): <quote part="I">But though in marriage the dominant woman threatens the proper ordering of a household, in courtship the woman enjoys a superior position.

Women who take seriously such lavish expressions of praise and worship as sonnet lovers heap upon them will not take easily to the altered marital situation. Such praise the lover in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> heaps upon Luciana; he calls her <quote>our earth’s wonder,</quote> <quote>more than earth divine,</quote> <quote>a god,</quote> <quote>sweet mermaid,</quote> and <quote>siren</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0819" targetEnd="#tln_0834">819–34</ref>]).

<p>That meal takes on thematic life. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tile1965"><name type="app">Tillyard</name></ref> (1965, pp. 54–5): <quote part="I">We find Shakespeare following what was to prove his permanent instinct: never to forsake the norm of social life. However distant he may get from that norm into inhuman horror, or wild romance, or lyrical fantasy, or mystical heights, he always reverts, if only for a short spell, to the ordinary world of men and to its problems of how they are to live together.&hellip;It is an instinct that has made Shakespeare so widely loved and the lack of which explains the comparative neglect of Spenser.

<p><quote part="F">Take the setting.&hellip;Ephesus itself is a small ordinary town where everyone knows everyone else’s business, where merchants pre&shy;[<hi rend="italic">55</hi>]dominate, and where dinner is a serious matter.&hellip;Antipholus has indeed been laying up trouble for himself, for not only is he shockingly late for dinner but he is bringing with him two guests, probably unnotified and certainly offensive to the housewife as eating a dinner that through over-cooking does an injustice to her domestic competence.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilj1984"><name type="app">Wilders</name></ref> (1984, pp. 14–17): <quote>It is possible&hellip;to discover more precisely the kind of reaction this episode arouses in an audience. We are presented on the stage with the spectacle of a woman of some dignity and self-respect publicly denouncing a perfect stranger for his supposed sexual infidelity in the belief that the man is her husband, taking him off to dine with her almost by force, and then shouting abuse at her real husband in the belief that he is an intruder. This series of events&hellip;produces in us an agreeable affront to our sense of social propriety, our collective opinion of how husbands and wives ought to behave. It may be that we enjoy the breaking of conventions by fictional characters because we are reluctant to violate them ourselves and welcome the opportunity for others to do it on our behalf.</quote></p>

<p>Perhaps Sh. added characters to the source, and discarded others to create (p. 15) <quote part="I">a small society and is thus able to depict a dislocation of social conduct on all its levels.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">16</hi>] <quote part="F"><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is thus made up out of a series of farcical situations interspersed with passages of moral instruction and debate, and these two elements are connected by the fact that both are, though in very different ways, concerned with social behaviour.

Even apparently [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] trivial passages&hellip;turn out to be relevant to the play as a whole in that they are concerned with questions of social behaviour. The conversation between the resident Antipholus and his guest the merchant&hellip;is about the nature of hospitality, and his brother’s punning chatter with&hellip;Dromio is about the notion that <quote>there is a time for all things</quote> [458–9: <hi rend="italic">there’s</hi>], a principle of decorum neglected by the constantly nagging wife.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_canj1990"><name type="app">Candido</name></ref> (1990, pp. 225–7, 229–31), on the high importance of the midday meal, says: <quote part="I">Clearly Antipholus of Ephesus’s failure to come to dinner on time is a repudiation of more than mere food; his absence from home is the first step in the flouting of an accepted social ceremony that helps define his identity as respected citizen and respectful husband. It is surely no coincidence that in the course of the play he is threatened with the loss of both of these socially and emotionally vital aspects of self. Reputation and marriage begin to dissolve together when the wrong brother dines at home.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">When viewed in this context Adriana’s behavior assumes a deeper and more richly suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous housewife. Her determination to refrain from eating despite the fact that her husband is two hours late ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0277">277</ref>]) indicates a serious attempt to maintain personal equilibrium and social bonds in the face of heavy pressures. Adriana&hellip;is a fiercely combative woman confronting squarely the threat of an imperiled marriage and determined to sustain meaningful ties despite social and personal threats to her identity as wife and Lady.&hellip;[Luciana’s urging them to dine shows an] [<hi rend="italic">226</hi>] indifference to her sister’s emotional plight that reveals the severe limitations of the unwedded woman’s easy aphorisms about marriage ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0289" targetEnd="#tln_0299">289–99</ref>]).</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_canj1990"><name type="app">Candido</name></ref> reports anthropological studies affirming the close connection between food and sexual longings and sexual identity. (P. 227): <quote>Adriana’s renewed enthusiasm for dinner with the man she thinks is her husband appears to include such psychological concerns. Despite the fact that Luciana will accompany the pair, theirs will be a rather private meal, <quote>above,</quote> symbolically located in the living quarters upstairs rather than in the more public business quarters below.&hellip;Clearly there is more at stake here for Adriana than the rearrangement of a disturbed afternoon. Her private family meal serves as a convenient social vehicle for the larger issue of forgiveness, and her insistence on privacy metaphorically links confidential family matters with the equally confidential regenerative power of the confessional: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0603" targetEnd="#tln_0604">603–4</ref>].</quote></p>

<p>E. Antipholus does not share his wife’s highly serious, highly symbolic view of this meal time, but still reacts badly when he is shut out.</p>

<p>(P. 229): <quote>By virtue of his denied access to home and wife, the Ephesian brother comes to experience precisely the same feelings of alienation and sexual doubt that he has so casually inflicted upon his wife.&hellip;Antipholus’s isolation outside the locked house functions symbolically to define the spiritual divorce he has already produced while at the same time literalizing ominously the ends to which his neglect will lead,</quote> the anxieties of isolation and nonattachment.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_canj1990"><name type="app">Candido</name></ref> says that the meal turns sour (p. 230): <quote>Perhaps less obvious&hellip;is the way in which the younger Antipholus’s behavior at Adriana’s dinner unwittingly parallels the unfaithfulness of his brother. As the symbolic embodiment of the younger version of his Ephesian twin, Antipholus of Syracuse reenacts his brother’s behavior by forsaking the woman who has welcomed him to the feast and turning his romantic attention to another.</quote> This slightly misrepresents the play, which has no dinner scene. In 3.2 Luciana upbraids S. Antipholus for unfaithfulness, but she is apparently talking about another woman, perhaps the Courtesan, not herself. In 4.2 Adriana responds to Luciana’s report about S. Antipholus’s wooing her in 3.2, not to what happened at the table.</p>

<p>(P. 231): <quote>Adriana’s broken banquet fails to produce its desired ends, but it nonetheless sets in motion a process of moral and social realignment that continues to the end of the play. Critics have generally tended to overlook the rejected wife’s response to her failed dinner, particularly her remarks upon hearing that at the meal her supposed husband has tried to woo Luciana.</quote> But again, the wooing takes place after the meal. He quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1125" targetEnd="#tln_1128">1125–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1131" targetEnd="#tln_1134">1131–4</ref>: <quote>The division here between heart and tongue&hellip;focuses upon yet another pair of forceful oppositions embedded in singleness. Adriana’s acknowledgement of her inner divisions&hellip;points implicitly to a means of finding concord in discord. Adriana is a frequent object of others’ criticism&hellip;yet despite it all she remains the most fully responsive and synthetic character in the play, preferring finally in a crisis to labor at forgiveness rather than to ease into recrimination.</quote></p>

<p>Problems within the family widen out into discussions of order and disorder. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_snid1876"><name type="app">Snider</name></ref> (1876; 1887, pp. 61–3, 68–9, 72) writes on order and disorder in the family, in the state, and in commerce. He finds three movements in the action: <quote>The first movement&hellip;is the narrative of Ægeon, who is the father, and, therefore, the head of the Family.</quote> He recounts the separating events. <quote>Thus the Family seems utterly disrupted and destroyed, but just this unhappy condition of things is the [<hi rend="italic">62</hi>] basis for a return to unity.</quote> But because of the twinness, the family has the capability of being acted on by chance.</p>

<p><quote part="I">It will be seen that Accident&hellip;is made the deity of this lower world; in fact, it is given such a wide sway, that it becomes incredible, improbable. But it is the Poet’s plan to endow it with absolute rule for once, and see what it will do with itself. What will the Goddess Chance make out of the government of this universe? Here we can see; she annuls herself, she cannot exist alone; that is, external Accident, like internal Caprice, if given full rein, destroys its own end, undoes itself and brings forth the world of order. In other words, such a world is comic.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">It is&hellip;necessary to notice the institutional realm within which this chapter of accidents is playing. Both Family and State are hovering in the distance; Ægeon&hellip;, in [<hi rend="italic">63</hi>] trying to bring together the scattered members of his domestic hearth, has fallen into the clutches of the law which is about to execute him. Thus even the State as well as the untamed elements of Nature seem to be hostile to the restoration of the family.</quote> But we, the audience, see order emerging. <quote part="I">We&hellip;see that the whole is the comedy of Accident which is destroying itself by conflicting with the supreme order. Providence&hellip;is bringing the scattered members of the family together, but he puts on the mask of confusion, and makes horrible grimaces, whereat the puny individual gets frightened.&hellip;But we must look through the appearance, must peep under the providential mask, if we wish to behold the comedy.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>(P. 72): <quote>Mistaken Identity&hellip;shows how the individual is [sic; word missing] through society, and society through the individual. We see that, if one unit be displaced and another taken for it, the whole fabric will fall into disorder.&hellip;The individual must have society, in which he finds his true relations—he can exist as a reasonable being only in society; on the other hand, society requites the favor and recognizes him as this individual, and none other, in all his manifold relations, and thus gives him a true objective personality. Mistaken Identity steps between society and the individual, and, for a time, destroys their connection. Each side, having existence through the other, will, by such separation, rapidly pass into confusion and dissolution.

<p><quote part="I">The design of the play, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">pace</foreign> Professor Baldwin, is not really based on a five-act structure on the Terentian model.

The over-arching framework, in spite of its threatening implications, is essentially benevolent. Against a ground of moving accidents by flood and field, it illustrates the normal workings of the temporal process in comedy, speaking of the great commonplaces of wedlock, childbirth, and familial piety and pointing the arrow of our expectations towards the fullness of time when all disorders are healed and all divisions settled.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">In a very real sense&hellip;such depersonalized characters become comic commodities whose purpose, in a metatheatrical expansion of the market setting, is their commercial values as figures of fun.&hellip;As recent economic historians have demonstrated, the Elizabethan age, in which individualism was just beginning to be awakened, was an age deeply concerned with a new sense of the market and the marketability of goods, of talents, and even of people.&hellip;While Shakespeare sets the story in Ephesus, the play, performed in London, takes on the features of London itself—the city of trade, the port for sea voyages.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hung1997"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> (1997, pp. 121–5): <quote part="I">Yet Shakespeare is careful to ensure that Aegeon’s crossings of the Mediterranean have not been merely romantic but also as practical as even Messenio could wish. The presence of romantic individualism as well as self-interest in the procedures of the merchant-adventurer allows Shakespeare to show the world of errors, deceptions, and supposes to be one in which loss and gain can be construed in terms both of money and emotion. The life depicted in New Comedy provides a natural basis for this double take. The <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> views social life as a petty competition for goods, for status, and for freedom to impose oneself on other people, so as to escape their imposition. Shakespeare by no means denies this image, but he is careful to represent the acquisitive life as more socialized and regulated than it seems to be in Plautus.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">In the opening exchange&hellip;the Duke of Ephesus establishes his position as primarily the guarantor of&hellip;laws that protect trade for <quote>merchants our well-dealing countrymen</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0011">11</ref>] (where <quote>well-dealing</quote> carries the sense of both <quote>good commercial practice</quote> and <quote>moral behaviour</quote>).

<p><quote part="M">But the opening scene is by no means a one-way commercial [<hi rend="italic">122</hi>] street.&hellip;The impulses to romantic identity and to hard-headed exploitation are required to interrogate one another, both speakers espousing self-deceiving and incompatible values.

Neither seems to notice his divided duty.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Even in the following scene, when the content signals that we have moved from <title level="m">Pericles</title> to Plautus, the same paradoxical union of nature and commerce continues to appear. The merchant we meet here&hellip;has taken good commercial steps to avoid a fate like that we have just witnessed in his father’s case: he has banked his money with another (Ephesian) merchant and has a false identity prepared in case trouble arises. Sociability is not the source of the compact with his Ephesian contact.

He is soon away, with <quote>Sir, I commend you to your own content.</quote> <quote>Own content</quote> is, however, a phrase that triggers in Antipholus’ mind powerful memories of a different value [<hi rend="italic">123</hi>] system in which content cannot belong to the individual but only to the family group: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0197" targetEnd="#tln_0204">197–204</ref>]. What the world of Ephesus seems to offer to both Aegeon and Antipholus (and what the art world of New Comedy offers to Shakespeare) is an orderly system of time (fixed inside an orderly social and commercial system)—time to be used to collect ransom for Aegeon, time to undertake the tasks Antipholus must perform in Ephesus; but this is time that these isolated individuals can apprehend only as meaningless vacancy, and that the society can define only as madness.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">What Shakespeare has done is to take the ordering system of New Comedy and place it in an estranging perspective, which shows its assumptions to be not the <quote>natural</quote> but only the learned routines of particular social groups. These are, of course, the groups that farce tends to fasten on—those who live too securely inside predetermined social systems, those we might call, briefly and anachronistically, the bourgeoisie. But, unlike nineteenth-century farce, <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, though it redefines private <quote>content</quote> as madness, has a larger purpose than <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">épater les bourgeois</foreign>.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">124</hi>] <quote part="F">The end of the play is very different from that of the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title></quote> with its proposed sale of the household goods and wife. <quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> ends&hellip;not with a business deal but with a miracle. The play comes back to the romance story of old Aegeon. The time of his reprieve is up, but time is no longer a merely sequential medium. The solemn procession to the place of execution has hardly entered before it is overwhelmed by farcical confusions as various petitioners demand contrary assurances about what has happened when. We are given unmistakable signals that anagnorisis is upon us; but before that true cadence can sound we must hear once again the contrary music of Aegeon’s frustrated longing and despair: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1788" targetEnd="#tln_1799">1788–99</ref>]. Shakespeare has reserved the play’s most powerful poetry for a special effect—to show us the tragic abyss of estrangement at the very moment of its comic release. For now romance finally absorbs error in a characteristic expression of the comic-miraculous. One by one the errors are unpicked and repositioned as truths. But they are not, we should notice, discounted: the dinner, the chain, the purse of ducats, the diamond, are presented as the factual markers by which any society (not just a bourgeois one) comes to know itself. Yet at the same time as these stubborn and irreducible facts are asserted, identity is celebrated in terms of a different set of values. At a new gossips’ feast the Duke will act as godfather [<hi rend="italic">125</hi>] for the rechristening of the members of the family miraculously reconstituted. Their names, the signs of their belonging together, integrate them not only inside the family but also inside the state. A sub-plot coda replays in a final vaudeville exit the comfort of established relations: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1909" targetEnd="#tln_1918">1909–18</ref>]. The simultaneity of a jostling exit makes a good theatrical joke; it also raises, one last time, the basic question of the competitive ethic, and it offers once again the play’s response, which is not to deny it or preach against it, but to set it side by side with the incommensurate ethic of brotherhood and family solidarity, and to leave it there without further comment.</quote> In a footnote to <quote>theatrical joke,</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hung1962"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> says, <quote>There may be, in addition, a reference to the Show of Amity in the <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>&hellip;where the representatives of Gray’s Inn and the Inner Temple enter arm in arm to show that their quarrel over precedence has come to an end.

<p>Three critics argue that Sh. engaged in the religious politics of his time.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_axtm1977"><name type="app">Axton</name></ref> (1977, pp. 3, 80–5) says that the law court revels and the plays staged there in the late 1580s and early 1590s were a forum for speculation about how the royal succession was to be worked out. She distinguishes what appeared on the public stage and on the Inns’ stage: <quote part="I">Although Elizabethan drama was often political and sometimes vigorously polemical in its function, theatrical conventions developed during this century were a protection to playwrights and performers. To my knowledge the Queen punished no Inns of Court dramatist or actor for displeasing her or her government with a play.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">80</hi>] <quote part="M">The revels [<title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>] of 1594/5 and Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> manifest their authors’ awareness of the specific political implications of such general moral and religious language.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">81</hi>] <quote part="M">The tacit notion in 1594/5 is that the theatre will instruct for the future; the lawyer’s prince and his knights might begin to model their behaviour on courtiers and player kings of the public stage.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">82</hi>] <quote part="M">The new setting Shakespeare chose for Plautus’s comedy of twin brothers had current religious and political connotations. Homely misunderstandings caused by the Ephesian and alien twins&hellip;by their very absurdity minimize the gravity of legal conflict between two warring states and prepare for a comic resolution.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">A rift in the <quote>old Amity</quote> between the <quote>states</quote> of Purpoole and Templaria was the revels theme in 1594/5. The outraged departure of the Templarian Ambassador on Innocents’ night, the second evening of the revels, initiated a deft parody of language and manoeuvers then employed between the English and the Scottish courts. Following this breach of amity <quote>a Comedy of Errors&hellip;was played by the Players.</quote>&hellip;The following day a revels trial inquired whether the rift between the two <quote>states</quote> was caused by an enchanter (a creator of theatrical illusions) or by misinterpretation of the law.&hellip;After trial the innocent enchanter was freed and the old law of misrule, impersonated by the revels Attorney and Solicitor, was stocked and <quote>sent to the Tower.</quote></quote></p>

<p>She lists the distinguished guests at the revels as they continued on 3 Jan., among them courtiers who had to suffer James’s outrage at not being fully invested with regalia when he was created Knight of the Garter by Elizabeth. <quote>Closer amity with Scotland was a question which arose in their daily government work.</quote></p>

<p>The play begins with the potential tragedy, Solinus’s decree. (P. 83): <quote part="I">But even as he pronounces the death sentence the ruler expresses a conflict within himself which the rest of the play will humorously and irreverently [<hi rend="italic">84</hi>] explore. Who sees truer in judging an alien, the law or the prince’s compassion? There is a conflict, as we see from the shifting pronouns, between the ruler’s two bodies. [Quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0145" targetEnd="#tln_0152">145–52</ref>, italicizing pronouns.]</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">His is a problem peculiar to a king <quote>twin born with greatness.</quote>&hellip;Legal differences between Ephesians and Syracusians seem more and more absurd as all the characters fail to distinguish between the enemy alien and his Ephesian twin. The quarrel between Ephesus and Syracuse which must cost Aegeon his life is preposterous.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Duke Solinus’s baffled inability to distinguish between an alien and a denizen when the twins stand before him (in Act V) undermines legal precedence so seriously argued by sixteenth-century lawyers: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1817" targetEnd="#tln_1819">1817–19</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1909" targetEnd="#tln_1918">1909–18</ref>].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Solinus’s participation in this festivity is figurally appropriate to Innocents’ Day, celebrated in the Gray’s Inn Christmas kingdom. The Old Law [of Ephesians] is put aside; in enlightened Ephesus there will be no slaughter of Innocents.</quote> The performance in 1604 was (p. 85) <quote>performed at court for the royal alien himself. James, living proof that there is <quote>a time for all things [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0458" targetEnd="#tln_0459">458–9</ref>],</quote> comfortably seated upon the throne of Elizabeth, was then deeply engaged in his cherished plan for the union of his two Protestant kingdoms.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hamd1992"><name type="app">Hamilton</name></ref> (1992, pp. x, 61, 64, 78, 85) includes <title level="m">Err.</title> with <title level="m">Jn.</title>, <title level="m">TN</title>, <title level="m">MM</title>, <title level="m">Cym.</title>, and <title level="m">H8</title> as plays that, if one can master the code, deal with church-state politics from the beginning to the very end of Sh.’s career, controversies involving presbyterians and puritans in <title level="m">Err.</title> Her emphasis is on <quote>the polemical literature that the church-state controversies produced [because] it is in such writing that one most readily encounters the discourses (the rhetoric, the idioms) by means of which the controversies were enacted, and not only confronts more than one side of an issue, but also learns how each side in a particular controversy appropriated the idioms and arguments of the other side.</quote></p>

<p>Her first, and repeated, example misstates the locking out of E. Antipholus. (P. 61): <quote>Suspicious that her husband has been unfaithful, Adriana locks him out of the house, an exclusionary tactic that is homologous with the official Elizabethan rhetoric against nonconformity.</quote> But what happens is that Adriana thinks she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> her husband, is reconciled with him, and orders S. Dromio to keep them from being disturbed (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0567" targetEnd="#tln_0615">567–615</ref>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hamd1992"><name type="app">Hamilton</name></ref>’s argument is that Adriana, who stands both for the established church that is keeping nonconformists out and for Queen Elizabeth, whose policies the church is following, needs to be encouraged to admit the nonconformists. The code Sh. uses involves such matters as (p. 64) his choosing Ephesus because, in the polemics of the time, the presbyterians pointed out that it was not clear whether Paul left Timothy in Ephesus as bishop, or as minister and evangelist; our understanding that the beatings are allegorized as the Dromios (p. 78) <quote>literalise the language of violence that had become the staple of the puritan and anti-puritan tracts and treatises</quote>; our knowing that the golden chain represents a <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">catena</foreign>, a collection of explanations about theological matters, usually Roman Catholic but made newly popular in Richard Perkins’s <title level="m">A golden chain</title>&hellip;(1591, Latin 1590); and the audience’s remembering (p. 85) that in the preface to the 1583 ed. of <title level="m">Actes and Monuments</title>, Foxe used the metaphor of a shipwreck three times in encouraging his countrymen to work toward the goal of unity, reuniting the families of conformists and nonconformists into the English church.</p>

<p>Some objections to this essay are: How can the code be performed? that is, how can any of the separate items—chain, shipwreck, exclusion—that combine in the code to urge the state to be inclusive in its dealings with the presbyterians, be made clear by theatrical means? Is it likely that Sh. assembled all the diffuse elements <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hamd1992"><name type="app">Hamilton</name></ref> identifies into his composition of <title level="m">Err.</title>? Say it was what happened, and only a few members of the audience, perhaps all the Gray’s Inn audience, cracked the code, surely the town gossip would let the code be known, and some record of the scandal (instructing Queen Elizabeth) would have come down to us? And of course there lies the last objection—verifiability. Interpretive criticism that illuminates unsuspected meanings need not be verified, but when plays are said to be intended to change state policy, the critic has the responsibility to show that some one of the contemporary audience understood what was being proposed in coded terms.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mila2001"><name type="app">Miller</name></ref> (2001, pp. 199–201) believes that England’s recent experience with Spain influences <title level="m">Err.</title> Philip II placed an embargo on English trade of a kind that echoes the trade war between Syracuse and Ephesus, including the threat and the reality of execution. S. Antipholus’s suspicion of Ephesus (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0263" targetEnd="#tln_0267">263–7</ref>) is a reminder that (p. 200) <quote>Protestant Englishmen held the same views of Spain’s Catholicism, which they regarded partly as superstitious hocus-pocus, partly as a potential conduit for devilish influence.&hellip;The absurdity of Papistry is embodied in&hellip;Doctor Pinch.&hellip;The threat of Papist authority figures and their murky sources of power materializes when Shakespeare entrusts the management of the dénouement to an abbess. In the notionally non-Christian setting of the ancient Mediterranean, the Abbess cannot be associated specifically with Papistry, but she surely carries some of its marks. If so, her wisdom and benevolence reverse the anti-Papist expectations of an English audience.&hellip;Shakespeare first gives Catholicism a human face, then finds for the Abbess a different and more reassuring role as the long-lost wife of Egeon, and therefore neither a nun by vocation nor even a challengingly autonomous female.</quote></p>

<p>He relates S.

<p>The beatings the Dromios suffer invoke <quote>the Spanish menace.&hellip;Had the Spanish invasion succeeded, Englishmen believed that they would have suffered the degradations of slavery,</quote> including whippings and brandings of children under seven.</p>

<p>Other scholars look to <title level="m">Err.</title> for clues to tell them what Sh. did in the so-called lost years (1585–92).

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard1a"><name type="app">Cuningham</name></ref> (ed. 1907, pp. xlii ff.): <quote part="I">Not to speak of the extreme improbability of Shakespeare having any spare time to devote to the [<hi rend="italic">xliii</hi>] technicalities of the law when in London and actively engaged as actor and dramatist, a careful and minute study of the whole works leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that Shakespeare’s mind must have been early steeped in the minutiæ of practical and technical legal work.&hellip;The apprentice to the law carried about with him through life a vivid remembrance of his early apprenticeship.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_matb1913"><name type="app">Matthews</name></ref> (1913, p. 70), thinking <title level="m">LLL</title> precedes <title level="m">Err.</title>, praises the plot, which <title level="m">LLL</title> lacks, and suggests that perhaps Sh. wanted <title level="m">Err.</title> to <quote>be free from this defect [of action] at least.&hellip;Entangled as the characters are in the deliberately contrived complications, the action is transparent to the spectator, who gains an added pleasure from his superior knowledge hidden from the persons of the play.</quote> He praises the handling of the intricacy of the structure.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fisa1931"><name type="app">Fisher</name></ref> (1931, pp. 102–3, 158) on good expositions in the early comedies: <quote>They are astonishingly clear and concise, and whatever may be the faults of the first exposition in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, it is a marvel of concision and clarity; perhaps indeed, it is too compact for complete theatrical comprehension.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">103</hi>] There is little time for people who are late to the theatre.&hellip;To miss the first scene of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is to miss half the contrast and suspense of the middle sections of the play and almost all of the surprise of the denouement.</quote></p>

<p>Denouements in comedy tend to assemble the whole cast, but usually (p. 158) <quote>the denouement&hellip;is essentially brought about by one person.&hellip;The errors might have continued in spite of the truth had not Antipholus of Syracuse simply appeared. When all the bewildered people gather to see him, the truth sweeps over them.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spra1935"><name type="app">Sprague</name></ref> (1935, pp. 116, 126, 128): <quote>That Shakespeare, even in the days of his apprenticeship as a playwright, was capable of writing good first scenes, is shown&hellip;in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>.</quote></p>

<p>Likewise the ending is good (p. 126): <quote part="I">Pooling their knowledge, the bewildered characters go over everything that has occurred, and the <quote>repetition in narrative of matters already seen in action</quote> [William Archer, <title level="m">Play-Making</title>, 1912, p. 75] is one of the most amusing passages in the whole play.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">128</hi>] <quote part="F">Shakespeare’s usual way of paying his respects to verisimilitude is to introduce a simple statement&hellip;postponing the detailed discussion of what has happened.&hellip;At the end&hellip;the Abbess invites the other characters [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1884" targetEnd="#tln_1885">1884–5</ref>]. The formula—for it amounts to that—is a useful one. It is realistic in a small way&hellip;it serves to get the characters off the stage at the end of a comedy, just as the funeral procession gets them off at the end of a tragedy.</quote></p>

<p>For <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ellg1939"><name type="app">Elliott</name></ref>’s (1939–40) comment on structure mingled with his emphasis on <quote>weirdness,</quote> see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0028-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0028-b"/>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_evab1960"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref> (1960, pp. 1–3, 7–9) on Sh.’s <quote part="I">reliance upon exploitable gaps or discrepancies among the awarenesses of participants and between the awarenesses of participants and audience.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">To describe the creation, maintenance, and exploitation of the gaps that separate the participants’ awarenesses and ours in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is almost to describe the entire play, for in his first comedy Shakespeare came nearer than ever afterward to placing his whole reliance upon an arrangement of discrepant awarenesses.&hellip;Comic effect emerges not once from character as such. If the Dromios prove laughable, it is not in themselves but in the incompleteness of their vision of situation that they prove so.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">2</hi>] With neither character nor language making notable comic contribution&hellip;the great resource of laughter is the exploitable gulf spread between the participants’ understanding and ours.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">This gap is held open from beginning to end: it is available for exploitation and is exploited during ten of the eleven scenes. In the course of the action we hold an advantage of awareness over fifteen of the sixteen persons—Aemilia alone never being exhibited on a level beneath ours.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The key fact that is quickly revealed to us is denied</quote> Aegeon and the two sets of twins: <quote>they are ignorant that all are in the same city.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_evab1960"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref> explains the effect of this discrepant awareness on <title level="m">Err.</title> and how it differs from other plays. He also makes the point that there is no <quote>practiser</quote> (p. 3): <quote part="I">No one here wilfully deceives another or even passively withholds a secret—for none here knows enough of the situation to deceive others about it, and none has a secret to withhold.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] <quote part="F">In these various ways&hellip;Shakespeare worked to make it credible that the participants should continue, throughout the bustling action, to be abused by error; that is to say, thus he kept open for his uses the exploitable gap from which rise the comic effects.</quote> <quote>Various ways</quote> involve keeping action credible, which he does by having S. Antipholus fear the sorcery of Ephesus and distrust his sanity and by having Adriana focus on her endangered marriage.</p>

<p>However, <quote>his addition of the frame story&hellip;greatly complicated&hellip;the system of awarenesses which prevails throughout the play. It also profoundly affects our view of the farcical scenes.</quote> The tragic note of Aegeon’s opening speech and the Duke’s pity there, and the remarks of the Merchant to S. Antipholus in 1.2 should affect us.</p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">8</hi>] <quote part="I">If the heavy emphasis given it [i.e., pity] is indicative of intention, Shakespeare meant the painful sound to be carried in our memories through all the fun until we meet Aegeon again, on his way to execution.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">We are thus obliged to observe the comic action&hellip;while our minds hold a spot of anxiety for Aegeon.</quote> This method becomes a <quote>regular formula.</quote></p>

<p>But <quote>just this once, he withholds not only from the participants <hi rend="italic">but from us also</hi> an all-important fact: he hides a key.&hellip;When we learn that there is an Abbess in Ephesus and that this Abbess is no other than old Aegeon’s lost wife, the play is within eighty lines of the end. Had we been told of her existence at the outset, we would have been assured&hellip;that all would finally be well.</quote></p>

<p>Sh. (p. 9) <quote>has simply deceived us,</quote> as he would do again only in <title level="m">WT.</title></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1961"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1961, pp. 55–8): <quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> has its large dramatic design, but it is no less remarkable for its controlled detail, unparalleled at this date, except in <title level="m">The Spanish Tragedy</title>, outside Shakespeare’s other plays. His handling of the lesser units of structure, from the scene downwards, is already sure, and indeed within its conventions brilliant. These units include the scene, a new one beginning whenever the stage is clear; the sub-scene, or <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scène</foreign> as understood in French drama, a new one beginning whenever the group on stage is altered by anyone leaving or joining it; the passage of dialogue or the set speech, more than one, sometimes, going to make up the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scène</foreign>; besides every physical action, whether procession, brawl, or bit of minor business.</quote></p>

<p>He gives a detailed analysis of 1.2. (P. 56): <quote part="I">Shakespeare has already the art of fulfilling, and with the economy that secures dramatic compression, three principal requirements of dramatic structure: retrospect, preparation, and immediate interest. By retrospect and preparation the playwright keeps his action moving—the great virtue of dynamic or progressive structure—with the strongest continuity. Further, while he concerns himself with the matter of the present scene, he can add force and meaning to what has gone before, and pile them up for what is to come after, so that, in effect, he is building up several (perhaps widely separated) parts of his play at once.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">With the first entry and speech of [1.2], there is interest in the appearance of three fresh persons, and some tension: Antipholus the alien is warned that he is in danger of the fate which overtook Egeon in the scene before; a fate summarized in the natural course of the warning. This retrospect, and parallel of situation, link the opening of the main action and that of the Egeon action within which it is to be framed. The link is strengthened by reference to three themes already started in the Egeon episode: risk (and in particular the hazards of Ephesus), wealth and time. Egeon, Antipholus is told:

<quote rend="block">&hellip;not being able to buy out his life
<lb/>According to the statute of the town
<lb/>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0167" targetEnd="#tln_0169">167–9</ref>]</quote>

Since these themes will be developed throughout the main action, the references to them are preparatory no less than retrospective. The theme of moneyed wealth is emphasized by stage-business: the merchant hands back to Antipholus <quote>&hellip;your money that I had to keep,</quote> and Antipholus passes it on to Dromio. The bag of money is to [<hi rend="italic">57</hi>] furnish one of the two subjects of the first comic misunderstanding, due to occur later in the scene, and therefore is implanted visually on the audience’s mind beforehand; moreover, it will form a parallel with the gold chain and the purse, other concrete visible properties which carry on the theme and become foci of similar cross-purposes in subsequent Acts. The second subject of the imminent misunderstanding, the summons to dinner by the Ephesian Dromio, is also prepared, and the time-theme touched, in Antipholus’ observation: <quote>Within this hour it will be dinner-time</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0173">173</ref>]. Another chief theme&hellip;is introduced when he is warned to conceal his Syracusan origin; for this concerns his identity. Again, when he bids Dromio depart with his money, Dromio’s exit lines: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0179" targetEnd="#tln_0180">179–80</ref>] foreshadow the suspicion that his master will shortly entertain, while preparing us to recognize it as groundless, a comic error. The rendezvous arranged, at the Centaur, leads to the reunion of master and servant in II.ii.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Dromio’s jesting exit ends the first <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scène</foreign>. It is Shakespeare’s cue for underlining the promise of comedy: the note of tension at the start has now passed into the background. It is the cue also for Antipholus’ direct comment upon Dromio’s character, which adds to what has been gathered of his own and of the relations between the two of them. The audience’s present curiosity about them is gratified, and its appetite whetted, both together; for the promise of comedy is contained in the informative comment itself: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0182" targetEnd="#tln_0184">182–4</ref>], jests, it is clear, which are very timely. Antipholus’ experience of Dromio as a jester is needed to explain his coming assumption that the invitation to dinner is his servant’s joke, and his slowly mounting surprise and anger when it is persisted in out of season. The rendezvous with the merchant, <quote>at five o’clock,</quote> like that arranged in <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scène</foreign> I with Dromio, helps to establish the theme of timing, and the motifs of timely or untimely meetings or failures to meet. It points forward, moreover, to the hour (cp. [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1587">1587</ref>]) so fateful for Egeon, the hour (though we do not [<hi rend="italic">58</hi>] yet know this) of the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">dénouement</foreign>; somewhat as the mention of dinnertime in <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scène</foreign> I began to make ready for the dinner episode (III. i), the play’s central pivot.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scènes</foreign> of three, then two persons, are succeeded by Antipholus’ first soliloquy. Here and in the two remaining <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scènes</foreign>, the immediate interest for the audience strengthens. From the point of view of comedy and the intrigue, <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">scène</foreign> 4, the encounter with the wrong Dromio, is the climax of the whole scene. It is flanked, in the ABA form so frequent in Shakespeare, by Antipholus’ soliloquies, which are the imaginative climaxes, and, together with the moment when he strikes (the Ephesian) Dromio, the emotional climaxes too, though there is contrast between his emotion as an exasperated and as a <quote>melancholy</quote> imaginative man. From the imaginative, introspective man he is, soliloquies (his brother has none) come naturally; his allusion to his <quote>care and melancholy</quote> has prepared the way for them.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fryn1965"><name type="app">Frye</name></ref> (1965, pp. 106–7): <quote>The primary reason for this speech [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1310" targetEnd="#tln_1320">1310–20</ref>] is not to rouse sympathy for the servant, though this is a secondary reason, and relevant to the context. The primary reason&hellip;is structural. The structure of <title level="m"><hi rend="clear">[</hi>The<hi rend="clear">]</hi> Comedy of Errors</title> is a metamorphosis structure, a descent into illusion and an emer&shy;[<hi rend="italic">107</hi>]gence into recognition. The main action takes place in a world of illusion and assumed madness; the imagery of the final recognition scene suggests a passing through death into a new world. Not only is Aegeon delivered from death at the very moment of his execution, but the Ephesus twins are imprisoned <quote>in a dark and dankish vault</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1724">1724</ref>], by <quote>a living dead man</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1718">1718</ref>] with no face. They escape by gnawing through their bonds, and the symbolism of this is at once pounced on by Dromio of Ephesus: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1768" targetEnd="#tln_1770">1768–70</ref>]. The Duke’s remark, <quote>I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1747">1747</ref>], and his comment when the twins meet, <quote>One of these men is Genius of the other</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1817">1817</ref>], fill out the same metamorphosis pattern.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1966"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1966, pp. 104 ff.) explores how the delayed identification of the Abbess as the one who can clear up all the remaining mysteries affects the play (p. 105): <quote>The very fact that the Abbess is a new character appearing at what is obviously a very late stage in the play arouses the audience’s expectations. Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus are on-stage already. The Abbess brings with her their Syracusian counterparts, so the pairs of twins are seen together for the first time. Obviously a solution is imminent; but we do not know how it is to be brought about. For a moment confusion seems worse confounded. <quote>I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1816">1816</ref>], says Adriana. Antipholus of Syracuse recognises his father; but the next (and major) recognition comes unexpectedly from the one character we know nothing about. The Abbess recognises Egeon as her husband, and thus reveals herself as the mother of one pair of twins. The implications of the revelation are unfolded in an episode of some length, allowing the audience to recover from its surprise (which may cause laughter) and to share in the different reactions of the characters as they readjust themselves to the happily changed situation.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1986"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1986, pp. 267–71) repeats most of this material with an emphasis on staging.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_haws1967"><name type="app">Hawkins</name></ref> (1967, p. 65) joins <title level="m">Err.</title>, <title level="m">LLL</title>, <title level="m">Ado</title>, and <title level="m">TN</title> as belonging <quote>to what&hellip;I shall call the <quote>alternate pattern,</quote> whose distinctive mark is unity of place.</quote> These plays are alternative to Northrop Frye’s comedies that he calls <quote>green world</quote> comedies, which contrast two locales; Hawkins describes similarities in the four plays.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_petv1974"><name type="app">Petronella</name></ref> (1974, pp. 481–4): <title level="m">Err.</title> <quote part="I">needs to be studied for the way it employs the structural pattern of separation and union—a pattern that&hellip;informs the language, characterization, and action of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> in a way that has not been explored in the past.&hellip;Separation is represented by references to, and acts of, severing, untying, releasing, divorcing, freeing, and losing; these are balanced by different representations of union: binding, tying, fastening, uniting, confining, and finding.&hellip;Separation&hellip;becomes associated&hellip;with categories such as illogicality, chaos, and domestic dissolution; whereas union is linked with logic, order, and domestic stability.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The play’s solid base [is] made up of four interlocking levels of reality: family, commerce, state, and cosmos. The last of these does not have as prominent a role as do the first three; nevertheless, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> present.&hellip;The social situation (commerce and state) is not [as?] central to the play’s meaning as is the domestic.&hellip;The principal search is for the natural bonds that hold a family together as well as a search for individual members of that family. In a more general way all four levels are marked by a drive toward overcoming [<hi rend="italic">482</hi>] estrangement or division.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_petv1974"><name type="app">Petronella</name></ref> begins by noting that Egeon, entering bound and reentering bound in Act 5, becomes (p. 483) <quote part="I">an emblem for the idea of confinement, especially as it applies to the level of state.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">At the level of commerce the word <quote>bond</quote> is obviously significant. But&hellip;the word also suggests binding, arresting, or pulling together toward union. All of these suggestions are supported by two symbolic objects: the controversial gold chain&hellip;and the rope.</quote></p>

<p>He furnishes an example (p. 484): <quote>State, commerce, and family are all part of the action in Act IV, Scene 4. Here are an arresting Officer (representing the order of state), the Courtesan (representing her particular brand of commercial interests), and two sisters.&hellip;The Officer has Antipholus of Ephesus figuratively bound by legal arrest, Dromio of Ephesus comes in with the by now ridiculous rope, and the three women&hellip;bring in Dr. Pinch&hellip;to separate Antipholus from the devil. If binding and separating were ever made farcical, here it is as robustly done as could be imagined.&hellip;The Ephesian Antipholus and Dromio were bound to their domestic responsibilities when we first saw them; now they are literally bound by the state and by Pinch’s would-be assistants in the absurd exorcism, which includes literal binding.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_leaw1977"><name type="app">Leary</name></ref> (1977, pp. 44, 47) marks the symmetries in <title level="m">Err.</title>: <quote>All those combinations of parallels, balances, correspondences, echoings&hellip;which delight the eye and ear and mind because they satisfy our peculiarly human rage for order.</quote></p>

<p>Everything comes in pairs. He counts (p. 47) <quote part="I">some eighteen principal errors scattered through the nine scenes [1.1 and 5.1 excluded], and these come at intervals that are spaced with remarkable evenness. There are three distinct sets of properties identifying each set of twins—six properties in all.&hellip;Evenly spaced speeches [recapitulate] what has just transpired, designed to keep everything clear to the&hellip;audience, who must never be permitted to share the confusions of the participants. The few scenes that border on romantic love (between Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana) are followed hard by mock-romantic scenes or lines to provide the kind of symmetrical contrast that Shakespeare will use [later].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">48</hi>] <quote part="M"><hi rend="italic">Rime</hi> and <hi rend="italic">meter</hi> are surely the most obvious components of linguistic symmetry. One-fifth of this play’s lines rime—a proportion exceeded in only three of all the rest of Shakespeare’s plays.&hellip;Patterns of alternating rime, as well as the more familiar riming couplets, appear, illustrating two kinds of symmetry.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">In addition to these <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> effects, symmetry appears in the <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> of the language as well. The <hi rend="italic">pun</hi>, which is by definition a wedding of sound and sense in symmetrical pattern, is everywhere in this play.</quote> He adds question and answer, pro and con arguments, cause-and-effect statements, <quote>the cheerful and primitive pastime of name calling,</quote> and vituperation, all without illustration.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_girr1981"><name type="app">Girard</name></ref> (1981), opposing structuralist analysis based on binary differentiation, asks what it is about identical twins that makes them so popular in the theater and indeed in the myths that lie behind theater. (P. 69): <quote>In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, and more generally in all comedies of twins, the characters deal with each other on the assumption that all of them are unique and immediately identifiable as such. If they did not cling to this assumption in the face of contrary evidence they would not become so confused. It takes more than the presence of undistinguishable twins&hellip;to generate the comic effects; it takes this persistent refusal to acknowledge the possibility of beings, human or divine, [being] less different from each other than we would like them to be.</quote></p>

<p>Paradoxically, he says, while characters—he is generalizing about comedies and tragedies—act on the basis of differences, they really are trying to imitate each other until they become <quote>xerox copies</quote> (p. 70) of each other, as the twins are in <title level="m">Err.</title></p>

<p>(P. 75): <quote part="I">Too much presumption of difference, too much appetite for difference precipitates the loss of whatever difference there was in the first place, with consequences that can be comic or tragic according to the manner in which they are treated. The perpetual disappointment of expectations alienates the characters from each other and even from themselves.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The moment comes when the characters undergo a breakdown of personal identity. Then, any one of them can exclaim, <quote>Am I myself, are the others themselves?</quote> In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> this moment occurs at the same critical point as in the other plays. Dromio asks his master, <quote>Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio, Am I your man, Am I myself?</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0864" targetEnd="#tln_0865">864–5</ref>].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">77</hi>] <quote part="F">Ultimately, undifferentiation spreads to the entire city. Twins and non-twins alike are turned loose into the streets screaming and fighting insanely. Then comes the recognition scene, just in time to avoid a real disaster.</quote></p>

<p>Finally (p. 85), <quote>The extreme frequency of twins in most mythologies does not go without saying. It calls for some explanation. When a myth resorts to twins, it must be trying to make a point and this point cannot be the difference between the twins, otherwise why resort to twins? The point is obviously the absence of difference. <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is more fun than structuralism.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gree1980"><name type="app">Grennan</name></ref> (1980, pp. 150 ff.) uses Luciana’s speech on order (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0290" targetEnd="#tln_0299">290–9</ref>) and her pragmatic advice to S. Antipholus (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0791" targetEnd="#tln_0794">791–4</ref>) to show that <quote part="I">the dialectic of nature and custom variously repeated in the theme, structure, and language&hellip;offers, for all its sober overtones, a way into the play that is true to its textual and theatrical possibilities, and provides yet another hint of the integrity and continuity of Shakespeare’s imaginative vision.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">152</hi>] <quote part="F">The mainspring of the comic action is a conflict between what is customary (or&hellip;conventional) and what is natural,</quote> where nature is Hooker’s <quote>that manner of working which God hath set for each created thing to keepe.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gree1980"><name type="app">Grennan</name></ref> gives examples: the law that condemns Egeon is <quote>(custom [<hi rend="italic">153</hi>] carried to its dogmatic extremity), and the natural sympathy evoked by the pathetic figure of the condemned old man</quote>; the <quote>overtly civil conversation between Antipholus of Syracuse and the First Merchant</quote> in 1.2 <quote>marked by the mannerly tone of polite social gesture (<quote>I crave your pardon,</quote> <quote>please you,</quote> <quote>Sir, I commend you to your own content</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0189" targetEnd="#tln_0195">189–95</ref>]). Left alone, however, Antipholus utters a speech that unravels the tightly woven fabric of this secure social world, replacing its fixity, its confident conventional identity with his own mysterious sensation of non-being: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0202">199–202</ref>]. Such undermining of the customary world continues to the end of the scene. Dromio’s breathless language and behavior must seem to Antipholus to be anarchic, <quote>natural.</quote> They erode the conventional master-slave relationship.</quote></p>

<p>And so on for most of the play: Adriana’s misery is natural, Luciana’s response conventional, E. Antipholus’s violence at being locked out is natural, Angelo’s response conventional.</p>

<p>As to language, it (p. 156) <quote>mirrors [the] action, offering its own equivalent of the structural pattern. Even a superficial reading&hellip;immediately reveals how conventional its linguistic and poetic elements are.</quote> Egeon’s opening speech is a (p. 157) <quote>conventional <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">narratio</foreign>,</quote> grounded in Aeneas’s account to Dido, its blank verse is regular.</p>

<p>(P. 158): <quote>Common to all these uses of language is an assumption that the forms employed and the statements made will immediately and in the way intended by the speakers be decipherable by the listeners. Even when the speakers are at odds with one another they use the language in essentially the same way. Both formally and substantively, therefore, language in such cases is being used according to custom and according to conventional shared beliefs about its secure relationship with non-linguistic reality—the world to which it refers.</quote></p>

Shakespeare combines Pauline and Plautine sources, mixing one of antiquity’s most spiritual writers with one of its most salacious. He gives us two kinds of supernatural power, the prestidigitatory exorcisms of Dr. Pinch and the holistic religion of the Abbess. He explores two kinds of personality loss, the negative in the fragmentation caused by grief, the positive in the sublimation of love. Lodgings are characterised by division and duality: the Centaur (half man, half beast) and the Phoenix (death and rebirth).

<head>Framing Structure</head>

<p>Many if not most commentators have something to say about the Egeon-Æmilia romance narrative that frames <title level="m">Err.</title> See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0035-01">35–142</ref>. The following are special studies devoted to the frame.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gawa1926a"><name type="app">Gaw</name></ref> (<title level="a">Evolution,</title> 1926, pp. 628–9) finds five dramaturgic functions for the frame story: <quote part="I">1. The frame&hellip;substitutes [for Plautus’s Prologue] an organic exposition in dramatic dialogue within the play proper. And this exposition is strongly motivated. By command of the Duke, the father, in peril of his life, relates the story of his sons and the cause of his own wanderings. The scene ends effectively, with sentence imposed but temporarily suspended.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">629</hi>] <quote part="M">2. The frame is here an effective device for promoting plot unity. Without it the internal plot&hellip;impresses one as a rather loosely knit series of comic happenings. The frame gives a firm beginning and a firm, definite, and massive ending. That this is somewhat contrasted in tone with the misadventures that form the main plot merely, from this point of view, increases its effectiveness.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">3. By its tone of romantic tragicomedy the frame also combines with other elements&hellip;to lift the Plautan farce into an atmosphere of greater dignity.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">4. The frame increases the general happiness of the ending. Among the many points which it adjusts we may note the reunion of the Antipholuses, the curing of Adriana’s jealousy, the clearing up of the triangle situation between the two Dromios and Luce, the pairing off of Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse, the release of the father from his imprisonment, and the reunion of the mother with her two sons and her husband.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">5. The effectiveness of the conclusion is enhanced by surprise</quote> by the appearance of the Abbess.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilr1977"><name type="app">Willson</name></ref> (1977, pp. 12–13): <quote part="I">Though Egeon’s narration is indeed flat, the scene need not be: its context is one of trial, judgment, and sentencing, wherein the victim must be granted our indulgence. Egeon’s role&hellip;is created to give a tragic [<hi rend="italic">13</hi>] overcast to the comic business of mistaken identity.&hellip;Shakespeare’s own stamp and the taste of his audience account for this somber beginning, as well as for the mixing of mirth and melancholy in the play proper.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">A long, <quote>flat,</quote> and <quote>colourless</quote> speech may be necessary for other reasons, not immediately perceived if we use only the expository criterion. Egeon is seen only at the beginning and again at the end of this short play: his presence obviously a framework of poignancy and standard of misfortune standing in contrast to the [?]advented absurdities of the twins’ story.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_petd1995"><name type="app">Peterson</name></ref> (1995, pp. 37 ff.) studies <quote>a compositional schema</quote> in many plays: <quote part="I">In each instance a threat of death initiates the main action.&hellip;Each threat is followed&hellip;by a sudden and radical shift in dramatic focus. Egeon is left behind [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0160" targetEnd="#tln_0161">160–1</ref>], while we follow his son, Antipholus of Syracuse, into what seems to him to be a strange and dream-like world of inexplicable occurrences.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">38</hi>] <quote part="F">The result&hellip;is a play consisting of two distinct and radically different kinds of action, each with its own beginning and ending, and with one enframing the other. The enframing actions are recognizable as common to the world we leave behind when we enter the theater to be free for a time of its claims.&hellip;The enframed actions on the other hand, are playful and even farcical and are set in places where the laws of verisimilitude and probability, along with clocktime itself, have been set aside.</quote></p>

<p>He finds this pattern, the <quote>mimetic</quote> frame and the <quote>ludic</quote> enframed (p. 39), <quote>at least as old as the secular drama itself.</quote> The first instructs, the second entertains.</p>

<p>(P. 42): <quote>The result [in <title level="m">Err.</title>] is two comedies in one, a diverting interval of ludic <quote>recreation</quote> and a <quote>rare and wonderful</quote> fiction which offers&hellip;a more substantial form of recreation in the form of an exemplary pattern. Each comic action, moreover, as a result of Shakespeare’s enframing the ludic within the mimetic, serves the purpose of the other. Once underway, the interval of <quote>mirth and game</quote> completely engages the audience’s attention until the errors out of which it develops have been discovered. For this ludic interval of escape from [<hi rend="italic">43</hi>] the world of everyday the story of Egeon serves simply as a frame or <quote>transitional</quote> fiction. Once the Egeon story comes full circle in the final reunion scene, the relationship between the two is reversed. Now the merry tale of mistaken identities is not only subordinate; when viewed from the perspective established by the reunions scene, it actually serves the purpose of the exemplary tale of loss and recovery by serving as a parodic opposite for the <quote>perfect pattern</quote> that is <quote>figured forth</quote> in the reunion.</quote> It is hard to know whom he is quoting; not <title level="m">Err.</title></p>

<p>The ludic plot <quote>always fulfills its purpose as a diverting recreation. The other comedy is conceptual. It requires&hellip;wonder and reflection. Reflection leads, finally, to a recognition of the <quote>recreational</quote> value of Egeon’s reunion with his wife and sons. A father, assured of heirs, no longer despairs. His sons in being <quote>reborn</quote> have regained fully their identities and are ready, in turn—one through an impending marriage, the other through a marriage restored to harmony—to participate in the communal life of Ephesus and Syracuse.</quote></p>

<div type="level4" xml:id="div_tech_str_fiveact">
<head>Five-Act Structure</head>

<p>One issue about structure is that of the so-called five-act structure, that is, whether <title level="m">Err.</title>, like other public playhouse plays before about 1606, was written according to the neoclassic analysis of Terence’s plays, was numbered by the author or some other person, and was acted with pauses or continuously. The most recent review is <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg1993"><name type="app">Taylor</name> &amp; <name type="app">Jowett</name></ref> (1993).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (ed. 1928, pp. xxvi ff.) had not yet articulated what he came to call the Terentian formula, but he analyzes the plot firmly in terms of acts. He summarizes the plot of Acts 1 and 2, showing how they set up the frame story and the first errors. Then (p. xxviii): <quote>This third act is the heart of the play, with all the preceding action preparing for it, and all the succeeding action flowing from it. This is the regular situation in one of Shakespeare’s plays, since it is here that he places the turning point in his action.</quote> He probably means <quote>all of Sh.’s plays.</quote></p>

<p>(P. xxix): <quote>Since&hellip;the central idea is a series of errors leading to eventual recognition, then we must have the first narrowly avoided recognition in the third act. Incidentally, a second narrowly avoided one occurs in the fourth act [4.4, characteristically not identified here or when he gives the plot summary for 4.4], and the recognition in the fifth, this idea and theory forming the backbone of the play. But the <quote>error</quote> thread is only the main one; the others must also be treated in the same way. The third act is thus the place to begin the love of Antipholus of Syracuse for Luciana, which seems hopeless in the fourth, but ends successfully in the fifth. Conversely, the third act is the place to bring the forces opposed to the predetermined ending to their highest point. Thus we have the break of Antipholus of Ephesus with&hellip;Adriana appearing in the third act. Naturally, then, we have Adriana’s side of the break emphasized in the fourth act, and the reconciliation in the fifth. Also, Antipholus of Syracuse here decides to leave Ephesus, a decision that must not be put into effect if the story is to end properly.&hellip;Thus with the given materials Shakespeare’s theory of construction naturally determined what should be placed in the third act. Indirectly, it also determined what should be in the first and second, since they must prepare for the third.</quote> It is not easy to judge whether this mechanical process, laid forth so repetitiously, was the result of <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_balt1928"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>’s writing a school text, or whether it came from his regular style, to be seen in book after book.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1947, pp. 315, 579, 682–3, 703, 706–14) restricts his interest to the first point above, demonstrating with great erudition that Sh. learned to construct his plays on a five-act structure taught in the humanist commentaries on Terence that formed part of the grammar school curriculum of the day. I quote him at length because he spent so much of his career on <title level="m">Err.</title> and because summary is nearly impossible. Specifically, this structure, which he calls the <quote>Terentian formula,</quote> consists of the <quote>protasis,</quote> or introduction, usually the first two acts; the <quote>epitasis,</quote> <quote>the most busie parte of a comedie</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coot1565"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref>, 1565), again usually two acts; and the <quote>catastrophe,</quote> the resolution in the final act. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> shows beyond any doubt that these terms were taught to, alluded to and recognized by at least the boys who learned Terence when they were about nine years old.</p>

<p>Before turning to Terence, on pp. 682–3, writing about the influence of the biblical <rs type="bibleref">Acts 19</rs> as a source that caused Sh. to set <title level="m">Err.</title> in Ephesus, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> observes that each of the first four acts ends with S. Antipholus becoming increasingly determined to escape the witchcraft he thinks is being exerted on him. (Here Baldwin does not insist that these repetitions mark a five-act structure; he does insist on this in <title level="m">Genetics</title>, 1965, pp. 73–87, however.)</p>

<p>(P. 579): <quote>It appears probable that Shakspere had the conventional drill on Terence in grammar school, and that this drill would include some knowledge of the current five-act formula for the plays of Terence. When later Shakspere himself wrote plays, did he use any form of this five-act theory? I propose now to examine from this point of view the structure of three of Shakspere’s early comedies [<title level="m">LLL</title>, <title level="m">Err.</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>]. I believe that approximately in their original form structurally these are Shakspere’s three earliest surviving comedies, and that they were written, as their structure itself will show, in the order given above.</quote></p>

<p>It is not <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1947"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>’s way to move by straightforward exposition. He argues that <title level="m">LLL</title> was written first because it is a too-mechanical following of Terentian three-part structure and of the highly symmetrical pairings of Lyly’s <title level="m">Endimion</title>.</p>

<p>(P. 703): <quote part="I">But it will be noticed also that the shaping influence upon the structure of <title level="m">The Comedy</title> was the five-act formula. The particular variety used here&hellip;finds its first printed statement&hellip;in an edition of Terence without date but known to have been printed in 1550. The edition and the ideas are really those of Iodocus Willichius, but it is his pupil Gregorius Wagnerus who in his preface&hellip;phrases the formula with application to <title level="m">Andria</title>.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">706</hi>] <quote part="F">&lt;I, 1&gt; The first scene is merely a prologue to give the setting for the play and to prepare for the reunited family at the end of the fifth act. [<hi rend="italic">707</hi>] Father Aegeon is chosen to be the prologue and comes very near to being that constantly defined thing in Terentian criticism a <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">protactica persona</foreign>, since he is dismissed till the catastrophe.</quote> He summarizes the scene.</p>

<p>Sh. is following Terence’s <title level="m">Andria</title>, with its commentary by Willichius. <quote part="I">This structure is pointedly Terentian. Contemporaries would have considered that Shakspere had carefully observed Terentian structure here.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nevr1980"><name type="app">Nevo</name></ref> (1980, pp. 1–10): <quote part="I">Out of his Renaissance Roman and Renaissance romance materials Shakespeare wrought a form of comedy unmistakably his own. It is the function of two inconstant variables: the Donatan formula for comic plots, which serves as model for a multitude of variations; and the battle of the sexes which constitutes the underlying motivation of his variegated romantic-courtship stories. The formula was derived by the fourth century grammarian Donatus from his study of Terence and ceaselessly re&shy;[<hi rend="italic">2</hi>]peated.&hellip;<quote>Comedy,</quote> the formula runs, <quote>ought indeed to be five-parted, the first which unfolds the argument&hellip;</quote> (in another version: <quote>contains either the peril, the anguish or some trouble</quote>); <quote>the second completes the same. The third has the increment of turbations and contentions&hellip;</quote> (or: <quote>brings on the perturbations, and the impediments and despair of the desired thing</quote>); <quote>the fourth seeks a medicine for the turbations</quote> (or: <quote>brings a remedy for the impending evil</quote>) <quote>and is a preparation for the catastrophe, which the fifth demands by right for itself.</quote>&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The <quote>telos</quote> of this Terentian plot is the finding—discovery or recovery—of what was missing, that is, imperfect, at the start.</quote></p>

<p>In Terence and Plautus the characters have very specific goals. (P. 3): <quote part="I">The ends that are finally brought about are consonant with the original desires of the protagonists, but in excess of them. They get more, and better, than they bargained for, and this on account of a series of fortunate coincidences and discoveries&hellip;the lucky chances of which, in our precarious existences, we are in direr need than of any gift of birth or intellect.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">These stratagems of the New Comedy supplied Europe with its comic fictions for two millennia.&hellip;They&hellip;provided Shakespeare with his plots from <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> to <title level="m">The Tempest</title>.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">4</hi>] <quote part="M">In the early <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> just such a Menandrine narrative of separation and reunion encases the brisk Plautine mistakings and unmaskings of the <title level="m">Menaechmi</title>; and this has tempted criticism to become preoccupied with the question whether the meandering romance narrative of marvelous reunions (<title level="m">Apollonius of Tyre</title>, for instance) or the tight Roman structure of mistakes and [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>] unravellings took precedence in Shakespeare’s imagination. The fact of the matter is that both were contained in Plautus, and the historical bifurcation into medieval romances on the one hand and dramas of intrigue on the other is largely a matter of theatrical convenience. The plays foreground the tangle of errors; the romances—they have the time to do so—foreground the precedent vicissitudes.&hellip;However, in application to Shakespeare, a further parameter comes into play.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">After the initial sally of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> the wandering narrative of long-lost children and family disappears [until <title level="m">Twelfth Night</title>].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] <quote part="M">The telos of Shakespeare’s early comic plots then is recovery: the finding of what was missing or lacking at the start. And here the first great novelty is at once apparent—Shakespeare’s protagonists do not know what they want, except in the most superficial sense. They discover as they go along, and so transform the rather arid Donatan scheme into a heuristic device of immense potency and flexibility. When his protagonists, like the Romans in their happy ends, get more than they bargained for, it is not simply a bonus (admittedly considerable) of a son’s light of love turning out to be respectable&hellip;but an illumination of their entire lives.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">8</hi>] <quote part="M">Shakespeare’s implementation of the Terentian scheme (in the first ten comedies) runs as follows.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Whatever the predicament sets forth as missing at the start, be it a twin&hellip;it will be found. The plot’s formal coherence depends on this, and so does the audience’s perception of the play’s coherence. Since&hellip;the protagonists are themselves seekers, and only partly, or not at all cognizant of what they seek, the formal development is a continual, unfolding process of disclosure, during which, however, the protagonist and the audience are proceeding at different rates, that of the protagonist being positively retarded by tumults and confusions on the way, that of the audience proceeding apace by inferences and hypotheses.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Therefore, when the plot is finally resolved by some appropriate recognition which enables the objectives to be attained, the <foreign xml:lang="grk-latn" rend="italic">anagnorisis</foreign> is retrospective as well as immediate for the protagonist and holistic or integrative for the audience. The recognition invites in effect a second order or interpretative, re-evaluative reading of events for both.&hellip;Scales fall from the protagonists’ eyes.&hellip;The manifest purposes, desires, goals and motivations of the protagonists reveal their inner, previously concealed, or veiled, or latent implications.</quote></p>

<p>In New Comedy the trickster slave is the author of the plot intrigue. (P. 9): <quote part="I">In Shakespeare trickery has gone up in the world [no longer dependent on the utilitarian tricksters].&hellip;The freeing of the comic device&hellip;has great advantages for variety and flexibility. In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> the comic device is nature’s own—the freakish identicalness of twins—but thereafter we have psychological one-upmanship [<title level="m">Wiv.</title>, etc.].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The comic device meshes in marvellously intricate, varied and eye-opening ways with the comic disposition of human beings to be deluded, deceived, mistaken, unreasonable, perverse, irrational and subject to every kind of folly. This produces what the neoclassical theorists of the Renaissance, following Donatus, called the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">incrementum processusque turbarum</foreign>, the increase and procession of perturbations, or <quote>the forward progress of the turmoils.</quote></quote> The device then exhausts itself, no more can be done with it, and remedies take over.</p>

<p>(P. 10): <quote>But as they [the remedies] close the gap opened by the play’s beginning, they provide the audience with means for a full and final retrospective intelligence of the nature, in all its inwardness, of the desirable, the pleasurable, the good, the absence of which motivated the story.</quote> Because she extends the New Comedy pattern to all ten early comedies, her conclusions are richer for the whole series than for <title level="m">Err.</title>, which she locates first.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tetk1984"><name type="app">Tetzeli von Rosador</name></ref> (1984, pp. 13–17) studies the plotting from an Aristotelian and Terentian point of view, denying that plot is a negligible aspect, less regarded than structure, theme, and character: <quote>Neither for Aristotle nor for the Terentian theorists from Donatus to Scaliger is the meaning of plot confined to a rational ordering of subject-matter. All of them conceive of plot as having—and this is the basic assumption of this essay—a thematic dimension and an inexorable movement forward. The latter is inherent in the [<hi rend="italic">14</hi>] axiom of necessary sequence, in&hellip;the dictum that a play must have a beginning, a middle, and an end.&hellip;[<foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Turbae</foreign>, the complications of the plot, are to begin as early as the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">protasis</foreign>.] Thus the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">protasis</foreign> is not only intended to impart introductory information about the play’s setting and characters but also has to awaken the audience’s expectations. Even retrospection&hellip;must make the spectator look ahead; not only the end of the play but also the movement towards it must be contained within the beginning.&hellip;[The dramatist must master the art of] precipitation, of preparing a concerted forward movement.</quote></p>

<p>He analyzes Egeon’s opening speech to find in the references to a lost family that will certainly be found again the necessary expectation, comic precipitation.</p>

<p>(P. 15): <quote>But it is above all the plotting of Egeon’s life-story and of the first scene which by indirection ensures the audience that what they are watching is a comedy and which pitches their minds forward to a comic conclusion. Moreover, this is a kind of plotting which informs the rest of the play as well. The life of Egeon and his family from the moment they embark is patterned on a variant of the approved romance model of never-ceasing reversals from happiness to unhappiness to happiness. It consists of a plot-movement which, again and again, builds up dangers, unendurable suffering or mortal peril, only to bypass irrevocable consequences at the last possible moment.</quote> He recounts that movement in Egeon’s speech. Some later examples:</p>

<p><quote>The money Antipholus of Syracuse thinks lost soon turns up again (2.1 and 2.2); Antipholus of Ephesus eventually listens to advice and does not break into his own house by main force (3.1); Dromio of Syracuse escapes the claims of the monstrously spherical kitchen-wench, as does his master the siren-like enchantments of Luciana (3.2).</quote></p>

<p>He finds another pattern, an oscillation (p. 16) <quote>between&hellip;accelerando and ritardando.</quote> In 1.2 and 2.1 <quote>the easy introduction of stereotyped figures and the quiet unfolding of relevant themes are abruptly brought to an end through the entrance of another figure, in both scenes a servant. Now misunderstandings ensue and characterize the following part of each scene.&hellip;Both scenes close with rather meditative, subdued passages of thematic interest: Antipholus evokes the aura of magic&hellip;attributed to Ephesus ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0263" targetEnd="#tln_0267">263–7</ref>]) and Adriana pours out her jealous lament ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0363" targetEnd="#tln_0391">363–91</ref>]). This tripartite division remains the governing principle of scenic structure henceforward. Even if from the fourth act onwards the oscillation negates the scene divisions, the movement of the plot still pulsates regularly between turbulence and calm, is alternately speeded up and slowed down. (And appropriate changes of metre or movement between verse and prose underline these differences in scenic quality.)</quote></p>

<p>A danger of plotting by formula has to be averted. <quote>Shakespeare employs two plot strategies to counteract such mechanization. First, there is the repeated reporting of events dramatically presented earlier on. The Ephesian Dromio’s report ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0320" targetEnd="#tln_0350">320–50</ref>]) of the meeting with his presumptive master in the market-place to fetch him home to dinner first instances this plot-device. The incident is related again&hellip;on three further occasions through three different speakers [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0402" targetEnd="#tln_0414">402–14</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0550" targetEnd="#tln_0558">550–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0624" targetEnd="#tln_0633">624–33</ref>]. More than a third of the whole play is taken up by the narration of events which the spectator has [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] witnessed in the flesh.</quote> Most of 4.4 and 5.1 are largely given over to such reporting. <quote>These refractions of what has happened by those to whom it has happened provide glimpses of the suffering, jealous, choleric, greedy, mercantile humanity behind the swiftly moving plot.&hellip;The other strategy&hellip;consists in providing explanatory models for all the twists and turns of the plot&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0263" targetEnd="#tln_0268">263–8</ref>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0333">333</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_riew1990"><name type="app">Riehle</name></ref> (1990, pp. 89–97), who is as adamant that Plautus influenced Sh. as Baldwin is that Terence did, does what he can to dismiss Baldwin’s <title level="m">Five-Act Structure</title>; Riehle should be read for his counterargument.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg1993"><name type="app">Taylor</name> &amp; <name type="app">Jowett</name></ref> (1993, p. 45), who argue against act interval <hi rend="italic">pauses</hi> in public playhouse plays before about 1606, though they accept Baldwin’s demonstration that such plays were written on a five-act plan, think that <title level="m">Err.</title>, because it was performed at Gray’s Inn and was perhaps composed for the revels there, is an example of authorial act dividing, <quote>without in any way reflecting early (or late) practice in the outdoor theatres.</quote></p>

<head>Audience Involvement</head>

<p>A recent approach to the play sees the audience in the theater as being forced to participate in the play. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shac1980"><name type="app">Shaw</name></ref> (1980, pp. 17–18, 21–6): <quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> holds a place unique in the Shakespearean canon because it shows at once the most direct derivation from Roman comedy and, at the same time, an awareness of contemporary audience and occasion. This does not mean that the drama of the intervening years, particularly that of Renaissance Italy and the native English tradition, does not show its influence. Rather, there is something to be gained by looking at either end of a creative process—the pressure of Latin comedy at the beginning and the demands of occasion on performance at the end. If we can assume that this play as we have it in the Folio text shows signs of catering to an audience at least as learned as the playwright, then awareness of specific audience and perhaps also of the specific occasion of the Christmas revels at Gray’s Inn in December, 1594, encouraged Shakespeare to indulge in authorial virtuosity.&hellip;[I want to view the] play as an artistic performance whose comic success depends upon an [<hi rend="italic">18</hi>] awareness of its deliberate eclecticism and of a craft expressly designed to set up a confrontation between stage representation and audience expectation.</quote></p>

<p>She notes that little of the play is in prose and that the Dromios use blank verse when they are getting beaten and that <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0629" targetEnd="#tln_0746">629–746</ref> is in rhymed couplets. <quote>Surely, the couching of such Plautine buffoonery in blank verse and rhyme suggests a conscious dichotomy for comic effect. Perhaps in this Shakespeare is following the lead of the courtly John Lyly&hellip;; but if he is, then his audience would recognize the technique of imitation as well as the deliberate juxtaposition of action and speech pattern.</quote></p>

<p>She continues with Terentian expansion of plot by <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">contaminatio</foreign> and how Sh. enriches the tone of the play as well, taking his cue from Terence again.</p>

<p>(P. 21): <quote part="I">Adriana&hellip;prevents the serious concerns from swamping the whole play.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">22</hi>] <quote part="F">This view of Adriana should lead us to consider with a somewhat less serious eye the disputation on husband-wife relations in which she engages with Luciana. Adriana is clearly a crowd-pleaser, and perhaps her considerations of marriage are designed to titillate a sophisticated mixed audience.&hellip;Adriana takes a firm view; a man is <quote>unruly</quote> and <quote>feeds from home</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0376" targetEnd="#tln_0377">376–7</ref>]), and, therefore, a wife should be demanding and keep a tight rein.&hellip;[In <title level="m">The Brothers</title>] Terence shows that the wisest course avoids the weakness of either extreme [of submission—Luciana’s position—or shrewishness], and surely this is what Adriana represents at the end of Shakespeare’s play and, regardless of what scripture says, the position that would most delight an audience at once aware of the stylistics of the argument and of the Terentian compromise.</quote></p>

<p>Finally, how to account for the ending, with the last words given to the Dromios, not to those of higher rank? And why is it such a short play? (P. 24): <quote part="I">Per&shy;[<hi rend="italic">25</hi>]haps a plausible answer&hellip;is that the play as we have it&hellip;is the version designed to fit into the special entertainment [at Gray’s Inn].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">There is reason to suspect that <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> was&hellip;meant to be followed by a masque.</quote></p>

<p>She reviews the <title level="m">Gesta</title> description. <quote part="I">Considering the progress of events to the disorder, the indication is that had the evening’s entertainment continued as planned, the presentment, procession to state, and ceremonial compliments would have been followed by a play and a masque.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The end of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> seems to support this suggestion. After the denouement—the discovering and sorting out of the Antipholi [<hi rend="italic">26</hi>] and the Dromios and the joyous reunion of parents with children and brothers with brothers—the major characters, led by the Duke, withdraw from the stage to celebrate the happy occasion. The two servants&hellip;are left on stage to go through a series of burlesque gestures as to who will leave the stage first, finally agreeing: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1917" targetEnd="#tln_1918">1917–18</ref>]. This posturing is suggestive of an antic dance, one type of comic contrast that gave rise to the antimasque in the Court Masques and could have been intended as a prelude to the masque dances. These measures, if this were the case, would be performed by members of Gray’s Inn and their ladies taking the place of the professional actors for the dance finale.</quote> She is one of very few who take pains to argue how <title level="m">Err.</title> fits into the evening of revels, though many say casually that it may have been written for Gray’s Inn.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_husj1981"><name type="app">Huston</name></ref> (1981, pp. 14–18, 21, 27): <quote>He [Sh.] builds a plot of mistaking, self-consciously contrived, and then he exuberantly pushes his characters around the world he has trapped them in, all the while encouraging his audience, which knows the reason for the mistaking, to laugh with him at the characters’ vain efforts to understand their situation.</quote> This artifice, which keeps the audience separated from the play (he uses <quote>play</quote> as <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">jeu</foreign> as well as drama), makes it unnecessary to develop character.</p>

<p>Yet (p. 15): <quote part="I">In so addressing the audience, Shakespeare is, at least in part, attempting to extend the range of his mastery; he is including the audience, as well as players, stage, and props, in the world he controls. It is no wonder, then, that Shakespeare’s characteristic response to the members of his audience&hellip;is to manipulate them. He manipulates his characters too, and the relationships between these two kinds of manipulation variously define the worlds of Shakespeare’s comedies of play.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>&hellip;Shakespeare keeps his audience almost always at a distance from the action.</quote></p>

<p>We watch the action from a <quote>position of almost godlike superiority,</quote> while the characters try to make sense of what is happening to them by proposing hypotheses. Sh. simultaneously encourages his audience into the play and makes us keep our distance; we know nearly everything; the characters appear increasingly mechanical, leading to Bergson’s definition of comedy (p. 18), <quote part="I">the mechanical imposing itself on the human.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Almost. But not quite—because Shakespearean comedy is never as neat as a general critical summary would have it.</quote> He emphasizes the misleading beginning, analyzing 1.1 at length for all the <quote>discontinuities</quote> he finds, stating that discontinuity is thematic in the play.</p>

<p>On lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0040" targetEnd="#tln_0047">40–7</ref> (p. 21): <quote part="I">Egeon claims that his wife would have been happy but for him and for the fact that their luck was bad, and then he says that they were joyfully married and prosperous. The argument makes no sense. Of course, we know what Egeon means: the sorrow came <hi rend="italic">after</hi> he and his wife had been happily married for some time, when they were separated. But that is not what Egeon says. So overwhelmed is he by present grief that he makes it color even his account of past joy.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">And what Egeon does at the beginning&hellip;he does throughout: he tries to impose a perfect, uncomplicated continuity on the complex, discontinuous experiences of his life.</quote></p>

<p>After listing all other discontinuities—the errors—(p. 27) <quote>maddening, unassimilable discontinuity, expanding its compass and intensifying its attack, threatens everyone in Ephesus.&hellip;Clearly what is needed is the wonderful, restorative power of miracle,</quote> which comes in the figure of the Abbess.</p>

<p><quote>At last the playwright reveals to his characters the secret he has shared with his audience since the second scene. And in the process he dissolves, at least for a moment, the distance between audience and characters.&hellip;And as characters become temporarily an audience [listening to Emilia], Shakespeare’s audience may recognize that this situation is reversible—that an audience may be transformed into characters by a world more expansive than the one the playwright creates.</quote> So Sh. plays with his audience, of course surprising them with Emilia’s revelation. The effect of the play is to help prepare its audience to cope with the unmanageable discontinuities of their own lives.</p>

The Ephesian Antipholus requests money and is brought a rope by his <quote>servant</quote>; Syracusan Antipholus finds his Dromio bringing not a rope as requested [sic; E. Antipholus sent for the rope] but gold, just as earlier he had received a chain without asking for one.&hellip;The characters&hellip;devise numerous interpretations of these strange events, even though all miss the mark.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">When we attach a meaning to such objects, if we see&hellip;a social or symbolic meaning to the chain&hellip;do we do anything less, however more consciously, than the stage’s confused characters? We ourselves thus <quote>confuse</quote> or exchange an object so that we can avoid mere spectacle, and thereby we sustain that delicate balance of the visual and the verbal essential to the theater.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0051"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wolp1994"><name type="app">Wolfensperger</name></ref> (1994, pp. 13 ff.) offers a response-theory criticism: <quote>I shall look into the twin questions of how and in what thematic complexes Shakespeare avoids taking sides in order to guarantee the neutrality of his point of view and to leave the audience viewpoint indeterminate, and of how he seeks to clearly and unambiguously reveal his point of view and with it the viewpoint we are intended to adopt. My study can thus be seen as an attempt to reconcile deconstruction with orthodoxies and to bridge the gap between the two camps from the point of view of Shakespeare’s guiding of our response.</quote></p>

<p>He focuses on the sharp differences between critics’ sympathy or antipathy for Adriana (p. 21): <quote part="I">What has been one of the most intriguing questions&hellip;is in what way Shakespeare guides our response in view of the crucial thematic concern of marital rights and duties.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">26</hi>] <quote part="F">How can one account for the contradictory responses? Who is to blame for this apparent critical free-wheeling?</quote></p>

<p>He concedes that attitudes toward women have changed in the past fifty years enough even to make a mark on predominantly male critics, but <quote>I do not want to leave the impression that the cause for these contradictory and shifting responses lies primarily with the recipient and his environment. Quite the reverse is the case. It is in the first instance the text itself [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>] and its persuasive strategies that are responsible for the divergence of critical responses.</quote></p>

<p>Of 2.1, the debate between Adriana and Luciana on the role of men and women in marriage, he says that on the surface it seems that Luciana does no more than speak one orthodoxy, that of female submissiveness in marriage, and Adriana argue for another, one that opposes the double standard of morality and the analogy between husband-wife and master-servant. But he studies (p. 29) <quote>the comedy’s external system of communication</quote> that guides our response, for which see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0051"/>.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_petd1995"><name type="app">Peterson</name></ref> (1995, pp. 43–4): <quote>But closure has been won only within an ideal fiction. Closure to the play itself remains for the audience to determine. The rejuvenation Egeon enjoys through a strange and wonderful turn of events, the audience is offered in the form of a <quote>rare</quote> and <quote>wonderful</quote> fiction. In the closing moments of that fiction the silent figure of Egeon bowled over by the unexpected revelations and recovery of wife and sons is a reminder to the audience that begetting children is a way of defeating mortality. For those who embrace the solution it offers, the Egeon story will have been authentically recreative. For those [<hi rend="italic">44</hi>] who do not, the merry interval provided by the action it enframes may at least have proved a relaxing pastime.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_obrr1996"><name type="app">O’Brien</name></ref> (1996, §1): <quote>Shakespeare uses the possibility that Syracusan Antipholus is genuinely threatened by madness, and therefore death, to manipulate his audience’s anxieties.&hellip;Syracusan Antipholus’ descriptions of his <quote>transformed</quote> mind draw on specific, Elizabethan ideas about both supernatural and natural causes of madness.</quote></p>

<p>The supernatural is demonic possession, the natural is the physical infection from eyebeams carrying spiritual vapors that produce love melancholy. He associates the water-drop passages with other passages in Sh. that connect loss of self with water, and these he connects with (§5) Foucault’s statement (<title level="m">Madness and Civilization</title>) that <quote>one thing at least is certain, water and madness have long been linked in the dreams of European man.</quote></p>

<p>He concludes (§26): <quote><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is not <title level="m">King Lear</title>. Nevertheless, as I have argued here, this seeming farce touches upon what would have been a genuine anxiety for the Elizabethan audience. Syracusan Antipholus is struggling for his mind and his life when he cries out&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1224" targetEnd="#tln_1226">1224–6</ref>]. Such outcries are comic because the audience is aware of the cause of Syracusan Antipholus’ confusion. But however faint, the anxiety produced by fear of madness remains, darkening the play’s entertaining confusions.</quote></p>

<p>For support of his showing the seriousness of the physical cause of madness, he uses from <title level="m">OED</title> a definition of <quote>error</quote> (<quote>fury&hellip;extravagance of passion</quote>), the last citation of which is 1460.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gibb1997"><name type="app">Gibbons</name></ref> (1997, pp. 111 ff.) finds <title level="m">Err.</title> <quote>focussed on the dividing of an audience’s attention so that an episode can be understood from two opposite points of view simultaneously: a whole plot can have a double meaning apparent to an audience but not to the characters</quote> in the tradition of Renaissance <quote>serious play</quote> as found in Erasmus and More.</p>

<p>(P. 121): <quote>The disorientation of the spectator (and the would-be interpreter) are the very first things Shakespeare concentrates on&hellip;in its first scene. The opening lines sound like the end of a play, as a long court hearing concludes with a judgement: Egeon declares <quote>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, / And by the doom of death end woes and all</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0005" targetEnd="#tln_0006">5–6</ref>]. The impression that the case has been heard at some length seems confirmed by the Duke’s response: <quote>Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0007">7</ref>] and by Egeon’s answer, which repeats the stress on a long process terminating: <quote>Yet this my comfort, when your words are done, / My woes end likewise with the evening sun</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0030" targetEnd="#tln_0031">30–1</ref>]. The Duke brings matters to a close with perfunctory courtesy: <quote>Well, Syracusan, say in brief&hellip;</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0032">32</ref>]. Only with an effort can Egeon manage a reply at all: he sounds worn out: <quote>A heavier task could not have been impos’d / Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0035" targetEnd="#tln_0036">35–6</ref>]. So, a wordless valediction and a finis? What happened to the rest of the play? The spectators, put off-balance in this way, are disconcerted again when the apparently exhausted Egeon embarks buoyantly on his story with the leisured amplitude of someone who has all the time in the world. He proceeds for an unhesitating sixty-four lines, then briefly pauses—<quote>O let me say no more</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0097">97</ref>]—but only for rhetorical effect, while the Duke, having before enjoined brevity, is now egging him on: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0099">99</ref>]. Twenty-two lines later, Egeon’s narrative still shows no signs of arriving at the present; meanwhile the Duke is settling down for a story he clearly feels is only just getting into its stride—<quote>Do me the favour to dilate at full</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0125">125</ref>]). That it should be just at this point that Egeon runs out of steam (he can only manage fifteen lines more) is a further droll Shakespearian touch.</quote></p>

<p>He remarks that the play, in its dramatization of (p. 118) <quote>a providential pilgrimage that moves from a nativity to a last judgement&hellip;must also, simultaneously, be seen as the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi>. In the Pauline-Christian terms of rebirth (<quote>It is sowen a naturall body, it riseth a spirituall body,</quote> <rs type="bibleref" key="1 Cor.">1 Corinthians 15, 44</rs>)—it moves <hi rend="italic">from</hi> a last judgement <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a nativity.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0004"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tile1965"><name type="app">Tillyard</name></ref> (1965, pp. 64–6): <quote>I must digress about the use Shakespeare makes of gold, which is very frequently mentioned in the play. The motive of the gold chain&hellip;first enters at the end of the first scene of act two. Here Adriana tells her sister that her husband has [<hi rend="italic">65</hi>] promised her the gold chain. She then proceeds to moralize about gold in lines which unfortunately are corrupt.&hellip;It is at least clear that gold is solid and will stand up to rubbing in the way that mere surface enamel will not: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0385" targetEnd="#tln_0387">385–7</ref>].&hellip;But the gold chain behaves in a way alien to the solidity from which it is fashioned. It eludes its true owner, it leads to all kinds of mistakes, and the man to whom it is given in error enjoys it as one of a number of things of whose existence he is doubtful. In fact, though Antipholus does not actually state it, the chain for him is fairy-gold and might wither away to nothing at any moment. No sooner has the wrong Antipholus got the chain than (IV, i) we see a merchant pressing the goldsmith for a debt&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0997" targetEnd="#tln_1000">997–1000</ref>]. The rope is a substitute for the chain he would have [<hi rend="italic">66</hi>] given, had his wife behaved herself. But it is more than that, for it was no accident that the rope enters the play in a context of gold. As gold keeps on attaching itself to Antipholus of Syracuse, so ropes attach themselves, metaphorically and literally, to Antipholus of Ephesus. As the latter fails to get the chain that belongs to him and later the gold that should set him free from bonds, so does he get the rope’s end he has ordered and must submit to be bound by ropes in a way he had not bargained for. In fact, gold and rope are contrasted symbols of what the two brothers experience; and there is a delightful irony in the younger brother’s distrusting the first, and the elder brother’s not welcoming the second.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berr1972"><name type="app">Berry</name></ref> (1972, pp. 35–7): <quote part="I">The mechanism by which two sets of actors relate to each other is the exchange of money and the chain. These concrete objects become the foci of crosspurposes.&hellip;The physical/verbal emphasis is consistent: <quote>chain</quote> occurs 45 times, and <quote>gold</quote> (with compounds) 32 times. They compose an early test case for Shakespearean symbolism.&hellip;What does <quote>gold,</quote> with <quote>chain,</quote> signify?</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The first law of Shakespearean symbolism is that it is never forced. The symbolic implications flow easily and naturally from the literal object (or activity), which itself appears to emerge inevitably from the course of the play.&hellip;In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> the use made of <quote>gold</quote> (and <quote>money,</quote> and <quote>chain</quote>) compels two questions: what are the natural associations of <quote>gold,</quote> and what associations are especially generated in the context of the play?</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The second question dominates the first, for <quote>gold,</quote> [<hi rend="italic">36</hi>] clearly, has tremendous positive and negative potentialities.&hellip;In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, it is plainly regarded as an instrument of communication.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">One has to avoid a stock response to <quote>gold</quote> (and also, <quote>chain</quote>) as something with innate criminal tendencies. Now in this play, no one <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> gold as a means of expressing personality, or of controlling others. It is purely a mode of doing business, and (for Adriana) of confirming that a promise will be kept.&hellip;The recent critical tendency to allow the obvious implications of <quote>chain</quote> to wander into the field, designated as Adriana’s <quote>possessiveness</quote> has little foundation in the text. For Adriana’s [<hi rend="italic">37</hi>] attitude is stated in her first reference to it: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0382">382</ref>]; and the word <hi rend="italic">promise</hi>, with its associations of bond-holding and oath-keeping is the major underlying concept. If Adriana had harped on <quote>chain</quote> more than the others, one could allow a certain associative transference, but in fact she does not.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_brud1992"><name type="app">Bruster</name></ref> (1992, pp. 75–7): E.

In the vacuum of formal financial establishments&hellip;they frequently assumed the role of [<hi rend="italic">76</hi>] bankers.&hellip;In agreeing to fashion the chain, and in delivering it to the man he thinks is the Ephesian Antipholus, Angelo makes a form of loan; the breaking of this obligation violates a civil agreement. Shakespeare intensifies the chain’s significance as a symbol of civic and professional responsibility&hellip;by constructing another social obligation, that of Angelo’s debt to the Second Merchant of Ephesus.&hellip;Where Plautus was satisfied with what one might call <quote>simple</quote> dramatic confusion, Shakespeare multiplies the line of dependency, suggesting&hellip;that discord on one level of society—that is, the familial and marital—translates into the breakdown of convention along others: here, the professional/commercial.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">77</hi>] Just as this scene, with its temporal urgency and confusion of identity, goes a significant distance toward encapsulating the action of the play itself, so is the golden chain—in its concatenation of wife, courtesan, goldsmith, merchant, and brother—a piece of dramaturgical currency emblematic of larger issues in the drama.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dawa2001"><name type="app">Dawson</name> &amp; <name type="app">Yachnin</name></ref> (2001) offer essays in which one argues with the other about whether to understand the Elizabethan theater (p. 2) <quote>on the more or less local situation&hellip;, finding a new understanding of theatrical pleasure in a study of the early modern idea of <quote>the person,</quote> the practice and theory of acting, the humoral model of the body, and the sacrament of the Eucharist</quote> (Dawson) or by <quote>locating it in the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">longue durée</foreign> of western cultural history, looking especially at the long-term consequences of the stage’s project of self-definition within the early modern luxury market</quote> (Yachnin). Dawson writes about the chain in response to Yachnin’s comments on the fetishizing of Desdemona’s handkerchief (p. 140): <quote part="I">The chain is a commodity, a fact that is frequently emphasized in the play, most obviously in relation to the money it costs and the many references to its possible or actual circulation (from Angelo to Antipholus of Ephesus, to the Courtesan, to Antipholus of Ephesus again, to Adriana, and tangentially, but crucially, to Antipholus of Syracuse); not to mention the fact that the payment for it is presented as the necessary means of bailing the goldsmith out of bondage both to the Merchant who appears in 4.1 and to the sergeant at law. It is clear that Ephesus is a [<hi rend="italic">141</hi>] deeply commercial city, dedicated to the circulation of capital and rife with merchants and ducats, prepared even to forgive its mortal enemies if they can ante up a sufficient amount of cash.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The commercial circulation of the chain is disturbed when it goes to Antipholus of Syracuse rather than Antipholus of Ephesus, a derailment that is not sorted out until the very end when, as the text suggests, the foreign twin hands it over to the native brother. When he first receives it, Antipholus of Syracuse transforms what is really a simple commercial transaction into a fortunate <quote>golden gift</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0977">977</ref>]), of a piece with the other mysterious goings-on that lead him throughout the play to expatiate on the sometimes dangerous, sometimes enticing mysteries of Ephesus, its <quote>mists</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0612">612</ref>, <hi rend="italic">mist</hi>]) and madness, its witches and sorcerers ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0265" targetEnd="#tln_0266">265–6</ref>]). In other words, he fetishizes the chain, mystifying its actual commodity value&hellip;; but the play as a whole takes comic pleasure in showing just how wrong he is. One indication of the real social origin of the chain is the fact, emphasized in the play and exploited as a source of the errors of the plot, that it is actually being forged as the action is proceeding.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Hence the detour via the wrong Antipholus that the chain makes serves a double purpose—it leads to a theatrical highlighting of the delusive, magical potency of the chain, and to a demystifying of that potency through an insistence on the chain’s commercial and artisanal origins. The audience is made aware of the careful process of producing luxury items such as jewelry.&hellip;And the psychological and cultural tendency to give such commodities more weight than they can easily bear is thereby brought into question, comically deconstructed by the chain’s circu&shy;[<hi rend="italic">142</hi>]lation. The demystifying process is abetted by the audience’s more or less unconscious awareness that the gold chain is <quote>really</quote> just a prop, probably made of lead or paste, not gold.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">But still, the chain remains a potent theatrical object—first of all by virtue of being highlighted on stage, and secondly as an agent of the cunning process of mystification/demystification and, we might add, re-mystification, that the text puts into operation. What I mean by this last point is that for all the insistence on the commercial foundation of the chain and its circulation, it remains a powerfully associative object, linked to the multiple bonds between brothers, between parents and children, between husbands and wives—i.e. to those primal sources of feeling to which Shakespeare returns again and again in his plays.&hellip;The play with the chain is an instance of theatrical self-promotion, deriving from a delighted recognition that it is the theatre, not the market, that confers a charge on objects as they appear on stage. To think of it in this way is to shift attention from Yachnin’s broad claim that Shakespearean investment in objects like the handkerchief is part of a long historical process whereby literature is born out of the theatre’s exploitation of the status system, to a more modest and historically specific claim that the theatre, in taking over and transforming cultural discourses, heightens its own <hi rend="italic">representational</hi> power.</quote></p>

<p>Others who do more than just mention the fact of the chain are <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_snid1876"><name type="app">Snider</name></ref> (1876; 1887, pp. 68–9): <quote>The third principle [after family and state] which is involved in this entanglement is business—the commercial relations of the community.&hellip;The matter [of not paying for the chain] is at first treated as a jest, then it grows serious, and at last an officer is called in to enforce the demand. Here Authority is drawn into the meshes, and is victimized by an [<hi rend="italic">69</hi>] appearance.&hellip;Public order is disturbed [and the resolution must begin]. But the difficulty cannot rest here; the abbess has defied the Family in the wife, and the Law in the officer; the conflict can only be settled by an appeal to the supreme authority of the land.</quote> But the Duke is likewise deluded, and all is clarified by the recognition of the twins; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broj1957"><name type="app">Brown</name></ref> (1957, p. 54); <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cutj1968"><name type="app">Cutts</name></ref> (1968, pp. 18–19); <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hamd1992"><name type="app">Hamilton</name></ref> (1992, p. 78): The golden chain represents a <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">catena</foreign>, a collection of explanations about theological matters, usually Roman Catholic but made newly popular in Richard Perkins’s <title level="m">A golden chain</title>, 1591, Latin 1590; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kina1996"><name type="app">Kinney</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_mowb1996"><name type="app">Mowat</name> &amp; <name type="app">Werstine</name></ref>, ed. 1996, pp. 184–5): <quote>The <quote>property fetish</quote> that has been seen as the basis for the English common law in the period suggests that the gold chain&hellip;was just the sort of acquisition that Londoners themselves focused on; both identity and status depended increasingly on one’s material goods. Because the society was more and more cognizant that what one <hi rend="italic">was</hi> was largely determined by what one <hi rend="italic">owned</hi>, the chief emphasis in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> on [<hi rend="italic">185</hi>] possessions, on being possessed (by marriage, witchcraft, or grace), and on being dispossessed unites the play’s Ephesus with Shakespeare’s London.</quote></p>

<p>Closely connected to the imagery involving the golden chain is that of the rope and its power to bind as well as to flog. Egeon enters perhaps bound in 1.1, and certainly reenters bound in 5.1 (see <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1823">1823</ref>). E.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_newk1985"><name type="app">Newman</name></ref> (1985, pp. 4, 44, 80–1): <quote>Soliloquies and monologic fragments&hellip;individualize Shakespeare’s characters and endow them with motive and intention, conflict and complexity. In other words, they communicate a mental life which we perceive as lifelike far more effectively than simple description of a psychic event. To communicate the sense of a character’s inner life requires a different mode of presentation.</quote> Monologues must be made to look and sound like dialogue, which best presents <quote>the illusion of mental activity.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0035">Plautus has been overlooked as a model for imbuing monologue with the characteristics of dialogue to give the speaker a mental life, using rhetorical questions, objectification of the self in second- or third-person self-references, and paradox. These rhetorical devices occur whenever identity is a serious thematic concern or when it is parodied.</p>

<p>These devices she demonstrates in Plautus and Terence, beginning with <title level="m">Amphitryo</title> [her sp.] 404–8 (p. 44): <quote>Didn’t our ship arrive this very night from Perse Harbour, and me on it? Didn’t my master send me here?

<p>Of 575–81 (p. 80), <quote>We find the series of rhetorical questions characteristic of such speeches which set up the I/you dichotomy of dialogue. The switch from the first to the third person, from <quote>I</quote> to <quote>our</quote>&hellip;includes the audience in the errors and mistakes which Antipholus experiences. The inverted syntax of <quote>sleep I now</quote> and the oxymoron <quote>sure uncertainty</quote> signal an unhomogeneous structure of answer and response.</quote></p>

<p>Of 608–12 (p. 81): <quote>Shakespeare uses rhetorical schema to represent his divided mind: antitheses ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0609">609</ref>]), anaphora, and chiasmus ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0610">610</ref>]).&hellip;These lines show Antipholus learning that identity depends at least in part on others’ conceptions of him: on self, but as Adriana has suggested in her speech, on others as well.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">One final example of the extraordinary test flights of verse&hellip;is the long, hyperbolic description launched by Dromio of Syracuse of the officer who has arrested his master: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1142" targetEnd="#tln_1147">1142–7</ref>]. The hyperboles continue for a few more lines, then are taken up again in the next scene for another sixteen lines ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1200" targetEnd="#tln_1215">1200–15</ref>—prose]). The Officer, who is described so elaborately, has no real role in the play but only acts as the vehicle of hyperbole.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1994"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1994, p. 57): <quote part="I">Although much of it is written in verse of considerable virtuosity <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is one of Shakespeare’s least obviously poetical plays. In it his verbal powers are fully at the service of his overall dramatic aims. Often the situations require no more than swift, economical writing, carrying us along briskly from one comic point to the next. But Shakespeare, already a master of dramatic rhythm, knew that the pace would become wearisome if it remained unvaried. From time to time he relaxes the pace of the ongoing action to allow the inclusion of passages of comic writing in which the situation is not advanced but enlarged upon. Such is Dromio of Syracuse’s brilliant description of the kitchen wench who, mistaking him for his twin, presses her attentions upon him: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0886" targetEnd="#tln_0891">886–91</ref>].&hellip;[Dromio’s] comic catechism&hellip;preserves the comic tone while giving us a rest from following the complications of the action. Equally brilliant in a different way is Antipholus of Ephesus’s description of Dr Pinch and his efforts to cure him of his supposed madness: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1712" targetEnd="#tln_1717">1712–17</ref>].</quote></p>

<p>He notes the (p. 129) <quote>tragic relief.</quote> <quote>We are told that Shakespeare gave real individuality to each Antipholus (as Plautus did not), and to each Dromio.&hellip;It is a hard thing to discover these individualities.&hellip;The differentiation between the brothers amounts mainly to this—one is married and one is not.</quote></p>

<p>Sh.’s superiority to Lyly is marked (p. 130) <quote>notably in the matter of putting in the mouths of different types of persons different types of speech. Pages or servant-boys, in Lyly, speak with rather more show of education and intellectual equipment than their masters. Shakespeare’s Dromios speak and think like Dromios, not like Antipholuses. From this very difference, it comes about that Shakespeare’s play has vastly more comic realization than Lyly’s.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cazl1952"><name type="app">Cazamian</name></ref> (1952, p. 194) on the result of the abandonment of reality in farce: <quote>One intimation of this confessed unreality&hellip;is that the characters are more or less aware of it. Their reactions when faced with the painful or ridiculous consequences to themselves of an absurd imbroglio are not quite those of flesh-and-blood people under the shrewd or humiliating blows of fortune; they grow most amusing when most persecuted by fate. The paradox&hellip;is very cleverly managed, and each participant in the general make-believe preserves his idiosyncrasies too well not to remain individual and convincing. But it is plain, at the same time, that everybody is out to make the huge joke a success.</quote> He calls <title level="m">Err.</title> a <quote>pleasant, though not deep comedy of character.</quote></p>

The real dramatic significance of their presentation, however, lies in the fact that each is presented with the adumbrations of a solution to his problem in the existence of his alter ego, and his inability to profit thereby is the result of powers as yet unrecognized, which blind him to the importance of the image in the glass.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chal1970"><name type="app">Champion</name></ref> (1970, p. 9): <quote>There is no significant development of the main characters; instead, they are manipulated into situations which are humorous as a result, for example, of mistaken identity or slapstick confusion.&hellip;The Antipholuses and Dromios&hellip;are&hellip;manipulated as they are amidst a confused wife, courtesan, kitchen wench, sea captain [sic], and goldsmith.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_turr1974"><name type="app">Turner</name></ref> (1974, pp. 163, 177–82, 191–3), studying the plays to 1595, discusses how Sh. applies his rhetorical training to characterization, e.g., on holding our interest in a comic character by devising (p. 192) <quote>a composite character, a simple collection of attributes</quote>: <quote>We raise no question about an underlying character that would hold together all his [S. Antipholus’s] attributes because he gives no indication of a distinct inner life.&hellip;His plans and motives coincide with his behavior so that he suffers no inner conflict.&hellip;[S. Antipholus] loves Luciana&hellip;because he is a young man, and it is natural for young men to fall in love; his irritation with Dromio we know to be characteristic of masters; [<hi rend="italic">193</hi>] his desire to hunt for a lost brother we attribute to his membership in the family. Yet the story leads us to make one tacit distinction among his attributes, separating the conditional from the unconditional. Antipholus’s irritation at Dromio is conditional upon their misunderstandings; his love for Luciana is an unconditional trait of being a young man; so too his desire for fulfillment within his family.&hellip;We assume that Adriana will become a patient, obedient wife once she has been instructed properly, that Luciana will love Antipholus once she learns that he is not her brother-in-law, and that Antipholus will not beat his servant once he learns the source of confusion. We assume that our standards of proper behavior are <quote>normal,</quote> so that some of Antipholus’s traits are temporary aberrations from the real and <quote>constant</quote> attributes of his class.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_altj1978"><name type="app">Altman</name></ref> (1978, p. 166): <quote>For here is a play about two young men looking for their twin brothers who cannot recognize their traces when they see them; about a wife who preaches mutuality between lovers, yet jealously catechizes her husband in bed, at board, alone, and in company; a husband who lightly substitutes the companionship of a courtesan for that of his young wife; a spinster, fearful of <quote>the troubles of the marriage bed</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0301">301</ref>], who exhorts her sister to wifely obedience. All habitually think of themselves in relation to their fellows, but actually draw a narrow perimeter around themselves that prevents community.&hellip;Their errors, it would seem, are a metaphor for their essential egoism, and the plot is a function of their characters.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ornr1986"><name type="app">Ornstein</name></ref> (1986, pp. 26–7): <quote>Most of the characters are mere sketches; some are ciphers of the plot and all must be hurried along from one perplexing event to the next lest they have time to reflect on the sudden irrationality and irresponsibility of those they have known for many years. If Antipholus E. had Viola’s [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>] thoughtfulness he might like her guess that his twin has survived and is being mistaken for him, but that would undermine the plot.&hellip;Shakespeare shows considerable skill in making the responses of his characters seem plausible. Although Antipholus S. has come to Ephesus in search of his brother, he has little hope of finding him alive, for that would be as likely, he says, as for one drop of water to <quote>find his fellow forth</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0201">201</ref>] in the ocean. Therefore it does not occur to him that he receives strange courtesies from the Ephesians because he is being mistaken for his twin.

<head>Adriana</head>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dowe1882"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> (1877; 1882, p. 67): <quote>Adriana, the jealous wife, has some individuality; she is more than an excuse for ridiculous accidents; Shakspere takes some interest in doing her dramatic justice; her shrewish temper is that of a woman who loves her husband, and who would persecute him into loving only her.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_maca1924"><name type="app">Mackenzie</name></ref> (1924, pp. 25–6): <quote>As a figure of wronged wifehood she becomes almost tragically convincing, which very fact makes her, dramatically speaking, the most serious blemish on the play. Adultery has always been one of the stock jokes of the fabliau&hellip;and its inevitable concomitant is the perennial jest of the <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">cornuto</foreign> or his feminine equivalent. For Adriana to have been simply the typical jealous shrew would be quite in keeping with a story that is half Latin comedy and half Renaissance <quote>merry tale.</quote> Probably she was first conceived as that, for there is a good streak of the shrew in her. But then she suddenly steps out of the frame of farce: the conventional carpings with which she has been answering the conventional smugness of her sister, break into the bitter reality of [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0365" targetEnd="#tln_0373">365–73</ref>]. At her next appearance she is face to face with, as she thinks, her unfaithful husband, and there is not only truth but an incongruous passionate dignity in her remonstrances.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_maca1924"><name type="app">Mackenzie</name></ref> (p. 26) quotes most of 508–39, then: <quote part="I">The underlying conception of marriage is one somewhat at variance with the Puritanic ideal in its full flower&hellip;where without loss of civil and ecclesiastical respectability, anyone may have as many partners as he can afford, subject only to the slight restraint of having them in succession instead of simultaneously.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Whatever we may think of Adriana’s tact or wisdom in thus appealing to her husband’s reason, the speech has in it a curiously passionate apprehension of the deeper values of a recurrent situation.&hellip;It is real and tragic: and it has no business to be either, where it is.&hellip;Even Shakespeare had to learn his business like the rest of us.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chah1931"><name type="app">Charlton</name></ref> (1931; 1938, pp. 68–9): <quote>Adriana is doubtless shrew, virago and vixen to boot. She breaks the servants’ pates across, though that hardly gives her characteristic distinction in a play in which fisticuffs are the regular means of intercourse. She rails at bed and board, and jealousy gives venom to her clamours, adding to them a virulence of which Plautus could scarcely avail himself, for it is only love in the modern sense <quote>which is full of jealousy.</quote> An English shrew, moreover,&hellip;is hampered by memories of the affection she once had for the man of her choice. Adriana even fondles at times. But her single lapse into the broken-hearted bride who will weep and die in tears is a fall both from type and from character. A more credibly humanizing trait appears in her excited enlargement of her husband’s frenzied acts: the duke is treated to a display of rumour’s growth, as facts swell with fancy when she recounts the incidents she thought she had seen ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1608">1608</ref>] ff.). Yet at the end of the play, the shrew is not so much out of countenance as she was meant to be.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">69</hi>] The general temper of life depicted in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is so crude, coarse, and brutal, that Adriana’s fault appears to be not so much her shrewishness as her undiplomatic use of it. Even the abbess accuses her of nothing more heinous than bad tactics: —[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1552" targetEnd="#tln_1555">1552–5</ref>].</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ellg1939"><name type="app">Elliott</name></ref> (1939–40, pp. 100–1): <quote part="I">We cannot imagine Rosalind or Beatrice exclaiming to a servant, <quote>Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0354">354</ref>]. But it is quite natural for their forerunner, Adriana, to speak thus to Dromio of Ephesus (line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0354">354</ref>]). Her sister Luciana’s rebuke of her—<quote>Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0362">362</ref>]—is histrionically revealing; such was the look that Shakespeare intended the boy-actor who <quote>created</quote> this part to employ continually. That look goes along with conduct, potentially at least, violent. And certainly the heroine of this drama has her full share in its mad doings. Yet louring impatience is merely on the surface of her; deep beneath is a devoted, yearning love for her husband.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">There is pathos, too, in her case, but the dramatist carefully subordinates it. When her sister urges her to be patient with her careless husband, Adriana exclaims [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0308" targetEnd="#tln_0311">308–11</ref>]. True enough. But our sympathy with the speaker is overtopped by amusement at her mood of angry exaggeration. She is far from being a <quote>wretched soul bruised with adversity</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0308">308</ref>]. Her only real woe, here, is that her husband is very late for dinner. To be sure, she hints that he may be with another woman (line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0304">304</ref>]). But this suspicion, entirely unfounded so far as the audience knows, is very faint and transient. All the more comical, therefore, is her great blaze of jealousy (lines [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0363">363</ref>] ff.) when the strange demeanour of Antipholus of Syracuse, mistaken for her husband, has been reported to her. At this juncture the device of mistaken identity is superbly used for comedy of character. Antipholus of Syracuse, unlike his jaunty brother, is gravely moral. When finally he enters Adriana’s presence and she regards him as Antipholus of Ephesus, he is exactly the man to <quote>look strange and frown</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0505">505</ref>]). No wonder his bearing turns Adriana’s suspicion into a settled con&shy;[<hi rend="italic">101</hi>]viction. But now comes the finest stroke of all. Confronted with real trouble,&hellip;as she believes, in her husband’s life, her better nature comes to the fore. She drops her initial notion ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0284">284</ref>]) that her own way of life should, by rights, be as free as her husband’s. She maintains indeed that there should be (in modern parlance) a single standard for both the sexes but she urges passionately that it should be pure and high [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0519" targetEnd="#tln_0539">519–39</ref>]. How direct and powerful is the style here over against the neat, conventional rhetoric of the preceding quotation! This is one of the many instances&hellip;where Shakespeare’s good luck or good revision, or both, enables him to sharpen the style in accordance with the emotion. Here the pathos, by itself, would be too keen for comedy. But it is checked, for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks of her two Syracusan listeners, wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by the mirth, madder than ever, that ensues.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sted1946"><name type="app">Stevenson</name></ref> (1946, pp. 186–7): <quote part="I">Adriana is concerned with the disparity between the worship she once received from Antipholus and her present lack of it. She is as unwilling to be pleased with Luciana’s outmoded ideas about the position of a woman as she is to resign herself to the unpleasantness of fact. She questions her own power to maintain her former exalted position [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0363" targetEnd="#tln_0366">363–6</ref>]. [<hi rend="italic">187</hi>] Not entirely in the farcical spirit of the rest of the play is her exclamation to [S.

She is so disturbed when the other Antipholus treats her strangely that one might think Shakespeare wanted us to share her tears and frustrations. She and her sister and her maid, and eventually her real husband’s mistress, form a dreary female procession through the quick twists of the plot. But I believe that Shakespeare expected us to laugh at them also, and that, in performance, would be largely a matter of tempo. The film of a funeral, even, may be made laughable if it is run off at twice the proper speed, and if we saw the bewildered women running and dripping at the same time we should understand how they fit into the whole farcical scheme.</quote></p>

These lines evoke the noblest Renaissance ideal of love—one soul in body twain—and do not allow us to dismiss Adriana’s complaints as shrewish jealousy.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The lack of any scene in which Adriana directly confronts her erring husband is striking because her misery and insistence on the inequity of her situation give <title level="m">Errors</title> much of its emotional ballast.</quote> Her complaints to Luciana and the abbess are not heard by her husband; perhaps Sh. was unwilling to risk making the other mistakes trivial by plumbing this discord. <quote>Although some critics have suggested that Adriana alienated her husband by a jealous possessiveness, she is not the eternally suspicious comic shrew that other dramatists portray. Her manner is never strident or undignified; her requests are never unreasonable.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_canj1990"><name type="app">Candido</name></ref> (1990, p. 225): <quote>When viewed in this context</quote> of her husband’s socially theatening tardiness for dinner <quote>Adriana’s behavior assumes a deeper and more richly suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous housewife. Her determination to refrain from eating despite the fact that her husband is two hours late ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0277">277</ref>]) indicates a serious attempt to maintain personal equilibrium and social bonds in the face of heavy pressure. Adriana is no mere jealous shrew (her readiness to forgive later in the play is too often slighted); rather she is a fiercely combative woman confronting squarely the threat of an imperiled marriage and determined to sustain meaningful ties despite social and personal threats to her identity as wife and Lady.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tile1965"><name type="app">Tillyard</name></ref> (1965, p. 57): <quote>Aemilia, a symbol of severe and stately authority, but again hardly characterized, serves the play substantially. Her unexpected appearance (and we can picture her as tall and commanding, and conspicuous in her black habit among the excited particoloured folk that throng the stage) is one of the great moments of the play; an abrupt check to the wild fantasy that has been accumulating through the previous acts and a sign that the resolution is at hand.&hellip;Yet, though thus an agent of normal human action, she is hardly humanized herself.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lega1974"><name type="app">Leggatt</name></ref> (1974, pp. 16–17): <quote>In the last scene the Abbess, not the Duke, is the real figure of authority, remaining calm and clear-headed while he struggles to make sense of the matter. She alone registers no surprise, accepting the strange events as easily as if she had expected them to happen all along. And she presides over the final feast, suggesting in her invitation that what has taken place is a new birth—thus linking the miracle of the ending with the normal processes of life: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1890" targetEnd="#tln_1896">1890–6</ref>]. [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] As the Abbess takes centre stage away from the Duke, so the fussy legalism he has represented is swept away by a deeper authority, the spontaneous force of life.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_husj1981"><name type="app">Huston</name></ref> (1981, pp. 16–17): <quote>The characters try to bring order out of chaos that develops during the fifth act, but they meet only with more confusion. When they appeal to the representative of the [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] Church for help, the Abbess tricks the woman who addresses her, supplies an explanation that immensely oversimplifies the problem at hand, and then retreats with material witnesses into the secluded and detached realm of the priory.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ornr1986"><name type="app">Ornstein</name></ref> (1986, pp. 32–3): In Act 5 the <quote part="I">muddle demands an arbiter with the fey humor and shrewd insight of the Abbess, who commands attention by force of personality as well as her religious office. Even before she knew that Antipholus was her son, she protected him against his pursuers, and she is unwilling to surrender him until she has cured his seeming distraction. With a woman’s instinct for the practical she questions Adriana about the origins of her husband’s bizarre behavior.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The comedy of the Abbess’s examination of Adriana is directed as much against her role as sage counselor as it is against Adriana, for she has a knack for clothing outrageous exaggerations in ancient saws: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1546" targetEnd="#tln_1551">1546–51</ref>]. [<hi rend="italic">33</hi>] By the time she has finished her explanation, Adriana’s household has become a scene out of Hieronymus Bosch, and Luciana protests the distortion. The Abbess, one suspects, has not spent all her life inside the walls of a convent. She knows something of men, women, and marriage, and her brisk confident manner is a happy contrast to the helplessness that is expressed in the speeches of Adriana and Luciana. One doubts that she ever viewed Egeon as her lord and master.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kehd1991"><name type="app">Kehler</name></ref> (1991, pp. 157–61), comparing Aemilia and Paulina in <title level="m">WT</title>: <quote>Both women believe themselves to be widows yet lack certainty. Remarriage, were they so inclined, is precluded. Shipwrecked Aemilia, who must find a means of subsistence, turns to the Church and serves Christ.&hellip;In both plays, celibate women undertake successful independent action, partly enforcing, partly subverting, patriarchal values.</quote></p>

<p>Egeon, in giving in to Aemilia’s desire to return home, reenacts Adam’s uxoriousness, and Aemilia shares Eve’s painful childbirth and loses everything. (P. 159): <quote part="I">Her situation contrasts sharply with her husband’s: Egeon has not entered the religious life. One reason, of course, is his responsibil&shy;[<hi rend="italic">160</hi>]ity for raising [his son and Dromio]. An equally important reason, however, is that religious withdrawal is not a male response to catastrophe in Shakespeare: men do not require protection. In the secular world, the male privilege of sexual freedom would not have been denied Egeon.&hellip;Aemilia, to gain the protection of the Church, must commit sexual suttee. Her thirty-three years of celibacy might be regarded as a patriarchally imposed expiation for sexuality.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Nevertheless, first having freely relinquished sexual power over men, then having yielded all to <quote>time’s deformed hand</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1779">1779</ref>]), the Aemilia of Act V is a figure of authority. Celibacy has enabled her to achieve power within the Church hierarchy.&hellip;Nor does the text suggest an end to Aemilia’s celibacy. Aemilia’s concluding speech abounds in Christian references that emphasize her former religious identity rather than a new or resumed secular one.&hellip;A defrocked Aemilia remains outside the play, difficult to imagine. Even an Aemilia who leaves her office to live with Egeon, ruling her household and extended family as she had the abbey, is more easily envisaged as a celibate—affectionately a wife, sexually a widow.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">161</hi>] <quote part="M">Aemilia rejects sexuality, ensuring her fidelity to her lost husband as she serves another Father, another Son, sublimating desire through love of a male-engendered God.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wolp1994"><name type="app">Wolfensperger</name></ref> (1994, pp. 71–2) points to conflicting attitudes toward the Abbess and accounts for them as the result of Shn. intentional manipulation. On the one hand her prestige and authority are insisted on by making her an Abbess, the head of a priory, and one who cures people. But she is undermined too: <quote>Not unlike Luciana in the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">débat</foreign> scene [2.2] the Abbess repeatedly resorts to proverbs and proverbial phrases, whose hollowness&hellip;undermines her conjugal counsel</quote> as noted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ornr1986"><name type="app">Ornstein</name></ref>. <quote part="I">The Abbess reveals herself to be an authoritarian rather than an authoritative adviser.

<p><quote part="M">[Her] authority is perhaps most decisively undermined by a crowning irony that has escaped critical attention: How can she possibly bring Adriana’s husband to his wits and make of him a formal man again, if she is housing the <hi rend="italic">Syracusian</hi> Antipholus?

<p>But we must remember that she is not responsible for a deliberate, careful plan that brings about the solution to the errors. <quote>It is as if Shakespeare is using her as a kind of last minute expedient designed to bring the comedy to a close, but at the same time denying her the full-hearted support he usually gives to his frame figures.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clac1873"><name type="app">Clarke</name></ref> (1873, pp. 525–6): <quote part="I">Luciana&hellip;is a domestic philosopher. She has conned lessons of connubial discretion in an excellent school—the house of her married sister, Adriana. She has learned forbearance from observing the other’s intolerance; she has acquired the art of making allowance, from noting her sister’s exacting impatience; she grows confirmed in smooth acquiescence, from seeing the folly as well as misery of irritable and irritating opposition.&hellip;While Adriana frets and fumes, Luciana gathers composure and a philosophy of obedience. Their first colloquy shows this characteristically: the one all heat and anger, the other all coolness and propriety. Shakespeare&hellip;has made Luciana&hellip;such a woman as would make one of those wives considered by common-minded men as <quote>model wives</quote>; that is, obedient and fawning wives. Luciana is calculating, submissive, and shrewdly obedient. She is ultra-passive outwardly, while inwardly maintaining a perfectly self-satisfied independence of opinion. Moreover, like all those women of systematic yieldingness rather than rational yieldingness, Luciana is given to palter with truth. It follows&hellip;that a woman who makes to herself a law, a mere calculating law, of blind and prone submission as the best course for her own interest, inevitably becomes, if not a liar, yet an equivocator, a sophisticator, a prevaricator, in some way a deviator from straightforward truth. All the little shifts and evasions; the paltry tricks and petty artifices; the carnying deceptions; the amiable falsifyings which women who adopt implicit obedience as their <quote>stock in trade</quote> in wedlock allow themselves, are the necessary growth of the course they pursue. Artful speech [<hi rend="italic">526</hi>] and conduct are sure to proceed from forced and unnatural compliance; and uniform compliance is unnatural.&hellip;[Quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0791" targetEnd="#tln_0801">791–801</ref>.]</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Luciana is a specimen of a prudent, judicious girl, who has a calm eye to her own comfortable welfare; who makes the failings and miseries of her friends beacons to herself&hellip;; who coolly reasons on her sister’s agonies of jealousy and remonstrance, drawing sedate lessons therefrom&hellip;; who quietly marks the marital despotisms of her brother-in-law, that she may know how to manage those of a future husband herself; and who, from her collected philosophy of serene observation, will learn to win a lover, to make a good match, and to rule her lord and master—all under the guise of being the meekest, the sweetest, the softest, and the most undesigning of her sex.

The challenge is exactly what the woman of to-day would urge. Yet in the rest of the play, though it is our sentimental sympathy with Luciana which has reflected on Adriana a deeper condemnation than has any of the formal charges laid against her, our sympathy with Luciana is not in the least founded on a concurrence in her explicit propositions about the relationship of man and wife. It is indeed Adriana who speaks with the voice of to-day in these matters. <quote>Why should man’s liberty than our’s be more?</quote> [284, slightly misquoted] she asks her sister, adding that none but asses will be bridled in such fashion by their husbands’ will.

No mortal in this world of ours now would venture to swear by such a creed: nor could a subject of Queen Elizabeth have easily dared to do so. And yet though Luciana’s terms are mere relics of the past, she secures from the moderns more instinctive sympathy than does her sister, despite the almost Georgian modernity of Adriana’s views on conjugal equality.

In her loyalty she tells Adriana of Antipholus’s advances (IV, ii). Though shocked with their impropriety, she takes note of their nature and admits that, addressed to the proper person, they would be in very good style. In another place her observant nature is conveyed with a subtlety that few readers would expect of Shakespeare in so early a play. In II, ii, Adriana and Luciana, mistaking one Antipholus for the other, try to persuade Antipholus of Syracuse to enter the house and eat the long-postponed dinner. Utterly bewildered, he allowed himself to be persuaded and tells us so in an aside. Whereupon, Luciana cries out, <quote>Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0582">582</ref>].

For her then to report to Adriana, with some show of anguish and displeasure, that Antipholus is attempting the very thing that she herself has just counselled him to do, makes Luciana somewhat less than morally trustworthy.</quote> Perhaps she <quote>calculatingly tells her sister of Antipholus’s advances simply because she wants to make an ostensibly clean breast of the matter.&hellip;[Then] she may get on unmolested with the entertainment of her brother-in-law.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_haic1978"><name type="app">Haines</name></ref> grants that this is heavy stuff. <quote>It can only be rejoined that the Luciana that [<hi rend="italic">113</hi>] complains of the troubles of the marriage bed while yet unmarried and tells her own brother-in-law to try to be more exquisite in the deception of his wife, is for many readers and spectators a character difficult to understand and not easy to love.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ornr1986"><name type="app">Ornstein</name></ref> (1986, pp. 31–2): In the debate with Luciana <quote>Adriana has the last word because here as elsewhere in Shakespeare’s plays, platitudinous counsel and painted comforts shatter against the hard reality of suffering and anger. Moreover, Luciana is not simply a spokesman for conventional pieties; she knows too much about the world to have any illusions about the way men treat women. When Antipholus S. woos her, she is not horrified even though she thinks him Adriana’s husband. Indignant at his advances, she does not, however, threaten to expose his <quote>adulterous</quote> (indeed, <quote>incestuous</quote>) lust to her sister and she does not rebuff him with pious sentences. Instead she pleads with him to be circumspect in his philandering and thereby considerate of his wretched wife&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0791" targetEnd="#tln_0798">791–8</ref>]. On other lips this might seem Machiavellian advice, but Luciana’s anger shows through her seeming acceptance of the cynical way of the world. She knows too well the emotional dependence of women on men and their willingness to deceive themselves about their marriages if their husbands will give them half a chance: [<hi rend="italic">32</hi>] [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0807" targetEnd="#tln_0808">807–8</ref>]. It is remarkable that the pathos of a woman’s subservience in marriage should be made more explicit in <title level="m">Errors</title> than any other comedy to follow.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hent1986"><name type="app">Hennings</name></ref> (1986, pp. 95 ff.) opposes the view of others—he cites <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_sig"><name type="app">Levin</name></ref> (ed. 1965, p. xxviii) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bara1974"><name type="app">Barton</name></ref>—that Luciana is the <quote>play’s spokesperson on the theme of marriage. But their interpretation does not explain the further development of Luciana’s character, her charactonymic link and structural parallelism to the erotic Luce, or why before the presence of Aemilia, Adriana rebukes the contentious Luciana and sides with the Abbess.</quote></p>

<p>Though she makes the argument for obedience and the double standard, she is running against a growing opposition to such behavior, as e.g., the <title level="a">Homilie of the state of Matrimonie.</title> (P. 97): <quote>Explicitly contradicting Luciana’s defense of the double standard, the homily defines the grand folly of human nature.</quote> He quotes—the gist being that men were to suppress their domineering and learn to be equal in affections.</p>

<p>(P. 98): <quote>Furthermore, Luciana’s own confession of why she is not married undercuts her pose as a moral advisor. Her claim that she fears the <quote>troubles of the marriage-bed</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0301">301</ref>]) points to a reluctance about sexuality and the consequences of childbirth, referred to in the homily as <quote>griefe and paines,</quote> the <quote>paine of their trauailing,</quote> <quote>great perils,</quote> and <quote>great afflictions</quote> (p. 243 [of <title level="m">Certaine Sermons</title>, 1968]), accurate enough when one considers the medical risks of the time and the number of women who died in childbirth. But overcoming this natural fear—that is, of being married—is the chief nobility of women, advises the sermon, which thereby counters the Catholic claims for celibacy.</quote> He quotes <quote part="I"><quote>this is the chiefe ornament of holy matrons&hellip;in that they refused not from marriage for the businesse thereof, for the gifts and perils thereof</quote>&hellip;(p. 243). In advising her sister, Luciana does not uphold those ideals about marriage and the perfection of women that the original audience had been taught to cherish.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">It would be unwise to overlook the charactonymic link between Luce and Luciana. In making the commonplace observation that the scenes of Luce and Dromio burlesque those of Luciana and Antipholus, we may note that as the drab [!] Luce represents the physical level of love, the supposed natural sexual lightness of women, so Luciana is thematically linked to her as her [<hi rend="italic">99</hi>] higher self, a secular, a social or psychological restraint upon human sexuality which proves ultimately ineffective in trying to control the sexual appetites.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">What is wrong with Luciana is that she here exists solely on a superficial secular level. She speaks to the appearances of things and sounds like Lady Macbeth: [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0798" targetEnd="#tln_0799">798–9</ref>]. Where Luce will almost physically mount her partner, Luciana’s approach to sexuality more subtly reflects the deep and troubled forces of the concupiscible appetites. As Kenneth Muir [1979, p. 21] has observed, she is attracted to Antipholus; and Antipholus—suspecting as much, believing that she has taken her own advice and is dressing her vice as the herald of virtue—mistakenly comes to regard her as a clever temptress pretending to be his sister-in-law inviting him to have an affair with her.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">100</hi>] <quote part="F">Of course Luciana does not consciously offer incest. Like every other major character in the play, she too has a good heart.&hellip;Luciana is not consciously aware of the folded meaning of her words’ deceit, although Adriana momentarily suspects that her sister’s deeper motives are not the least bit noble ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1121">1121</ref>]).</quote></p>

There is no doubt that most of the ridicule in [4.4] is directed against his attempts to exorcise EAntipholus’s evil spirits.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">63</hi>] <quote part="F">Shakespeare resorts to two more standard comic devices in order to discredit the exorcist: incongruity is one, automatism the other.

Nothing could illustrate this incongruity more vividly than&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1335" targetEnd="#tln_1336">1335–6</ref>],</quote> which is answered by Antipholus’s blow. <quote>The second comic device&hellip;is what Bergson calls <quote>&lt;a&gt;utomatisme.</quote>&hellip;Pinch is in his actions guided by an <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">idée fixe</foreign>, which deprives him of mental (and physical) flexibility.

<p>But he gives no examples.

<p>[<hi rend="italic">65</hi>] <quote part="F">If we turn to the question of how Pinch affects our response to Adriana, we can discover a very paradoxical phenomenon. At first sight, he seems to incriminate Adriana and discredit her. After all, it is her decision to hire an exorcist in the first place. On the other hand Pinch soon frees himself from Adriana to live a dramatic life of his own, so that Shakespeare is able to use him as a kind of scapegoat. It is he who is blamed and finally punished for errors committed by other characters; he is the scapegoat that Shakespeare&hellip;sacrifices on the altar of genre expectation and persuasive strategies. With regard to Adriana and her predisposition to excess and impatience, the quack functions as some sort of safety valve, or lightning conductor.

He then examines <title level="m">Err.</title>, <title level="m">MND</title> and <title level="m">MM.</title> (P. 10): <quote>Shakespeare improbably introduces [an] absolutist ideal of transcendent authority into his drama not as the overweening dream of a tragic or historical protagonist but as the comic desire of comic rulers.&hellip;Shakespeare represents political cultures in which independent legal codes impinge on the authority of rulers.

<p>Hence, when he does pardon Egeon, the act (p. 12) <quote>constitutes his own comic liberation. The law constrained Solinus’s desire.</quote></p>

<p>He notes that the pardon seems superfluous, since S. Antipholus has the ransom to free his father.

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0004-a"/>
<p>The play may be performed by 12 men and 4 boys, with, probably, a minimum of 4 nonspeaking extras, resources well within the capabilities of whatever acting company performed the play, either after the establishment of the Lord Chamberlain’s men in 1594, or earlier, by an unknown company (Strange’s? Pembroke’s?) (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gura1996"><name type="app">Gurr</name></ref>, 1996, pp. 59 f.). Actually there are 19 speaking roles, but doubling the Jailor, the Officer in 4.1 and 4.4 (and the silent Headsman in Act 5); the First and Second Merchant; Balthazar and the Messenger of Act 5; and Luce (perhaps never seen) and the Courtesan produces what would have to be the minimum cast of 16, 12 men and 4 boys (Act 5 calls for 13 speaking parts and the silent Headsman; Pinch, undoubled, and Luce do not appear). Casting 4 <quote>others</quote> would bring the total needed to 20.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_engj1926"><name type="app">Engelen</name></ref> (1926, pp. 43–4) notes the technical possibility of five doublings: Solinus and the Officer in Act 4; Aegeon and Pinch, S. Antipholus and the Messenger in Act 5; the First Merchant and Angelo, and Balthazar and the Second Merchant. She doubts that Luce appears, but thinks she could double with Luciana. Because Engelen apparently does not count the Jailor’s four words in 1.1, she has 18 speaking roles, which after doubling could be played by 13 actors. She grants that doubling S. Antipholus and the Messenger is merely possible, but unlikely because of the dominance of S. Antipholus’s role and the ease of other doublings.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt1927"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (1927, chart inserted pp. 228–9) assigns the chief speaking parts to actors he knows or believes to be active and available to Sh. in 1588–91. He says, for example, that Sh. played Solinus, William Kemp played E. Dromio, Henry Cundall (his spelling) played Adriana, and so on. His assumption that Sh. was already a member of a stable acting company in 1588 has not been widely accepted. This company, he believes, played <title level="m">Rom.</title> and <title level="m">H5</title> in 1590–1. He was anticipated in this casting by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sarg1897"><name type="app">Sarrazin</name></ref> (1897, p. 107), who suggests that Kemp played one Dromio, Thomas Pope perhaps the other, Sh. and Burbage the Antipholuses—Sh. perhaps the <quote>warmer</quote> S. Antipholus—and Edward Alleyn played Egeon, though he knows that Alleyn belonged to Sh.’s company only in 1593.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rinw1968"><name type="app">Ringler</name></ref> (1968, p. 123 n.) says that <title level="m">Err.</title> requires a minimum cast of 14 (see above), but does not cast the parts.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_hara1969"><name type="app">Harbage</name></ref> (ed. 1969, p. 31), in a table for all the plays, casts <title level="m">Err.</title> for 11 men and 5 women; these are the named roles, but apparently he leaves out the Jailor, Messenger, and Officer.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kint1992"><name type="app">King</name></ref> (1992, p. 80): <quote>Eight men can play eight principal and one minor male roles; five boys play five principal female roles. These thirteen actors speak 97% of the lines.&hellip;In minor parts, five men can play four speaking parts and seven mutes,</quote> for a total of 18. He counts Luce’s 11 lines as a major role, but doubles First Merchant’s 15 lines (in 1.2), Pinch’s 12 (4.4), and Messenger’s 14 (5.1) as minor roles. Doubling Pinch seems problematic because he is described with such particularity (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1715" targetEnd="#tln_1718">1715–18</ref>).</p>
<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0004-b"/>

<p>The play calls for three specific locales, the houses of E. Antipholus (the Phoenix), of the Courtesan (the Porcupine), and the abbey. Much of the action takes place in an area called <quote>the Mart.</quote> A stage direction reads <hi rend="italic">Enter Dromio Syra. from the Bay</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1073">1073</ref>). On the public stage there were two doors flanking an aperture, usually covered by a tapestry hanging (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gura2000"><name type="app">Gurr</name> &amp; <name type="app">Ichikawa</name></ref>, 2000, <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0038-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0038-b"/> below). Presumably one of the doors would have to do double service as the abode of E. Antipholus or of the Courtesan and as the entrance to the bay, since there is no evidence of entrances through the audience to the stage.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0006">How to manage the lock-out scene (3.1) is another problem. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pen2"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (ed. 1972, pp. 145–6): <quote>The location is before Antipholus of Ephesus’s house, in which his twin is dining with Adriana and Luciana. Dromio of Syracuse is guarding the gate, with instructions to let no one in.&hellip;At line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0651">651</ref>], Antipholus tries the door and finds it locked. Dromio of Syracuse speaks from behind the door, and so is out of sight.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">146</hi>] It may be that Dromio of Syracuse, Luce, and Adriana should be out of sight of the audience throughout the scene. But they have so much to say that this seems clumsy. Another possibility is that some convention should be employed whereby the audience can see both sets of actors, but they are understood not to see one another. There is no reason why Luce should not come into the presence of the on-stage party, but it is necessary that the Dromios should be kept apart, and that Adriana should not confront her real husband at this stage of the play. It may well be that the main point of bringing Luce on here is to have some servant other than Dromio to sustain the altercation. To have Luce throw the words <quote>What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are these at the gate?</quote> (line[s <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0680" targetEnd="#tln_0681">680–1</ref>]) behind her to an invisible Dromio seems clumsy, and there is something to be said in favour of the suggestion that Luce and perhaps Adriana should enter on an upper level—the upper stage of the Elizabethan theatre. This may be suggested by Adriana’s statement that she and her supposed husband would dine <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0603">603</ref>]). However, it sounds from line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0701">701</ref>: <quote>Let him knocke till it ake</quote>] as if Luce were expected to be able to open the door herself, rather than simply instruct Dromio to do so.&hellip;The producer is free to engineer the scene in his own way.</quote></p>

<p>Last, in Act 5, S. Antipholus and his servant flee into and emerge from the abbey. How that was managed on the Gray’s Inn stage, described below, or on any stage fitted with free-standing <quote>houses</quote> which might be quite small and thus crowded with three actors, is a problem.</p>

<p>The first recorded performance was at Gray’s Inn. See <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0003-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0003-b"/>, for an account of what happened on that occasion. Here I examine what can be known or guessed at about the staging itself.</p>

<p>Gray’s Inn hall (see diagram in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_knam1984"><name type="app">Knapp</name> &amp; <name type="app">Kobialka</name></ref>, 1984, p. 74, but notice that the compass points east and west are reversed) measures 70′ by 34′8″, dimensions similar to those of two Cambridge college halls also occasionally used for performances, Queen’s (44′ x 27′) and Trinity (85′ x 40′) (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref>, 1994, pp. 17, 43). The hall featured a dais (half-pace) at the so-called upper end and a hall screen with two openings in its five arches at the lower end, with a gallery above it, an oriel (bay) window on the north side of the half-pace, and a possibly 7′-sq. fireplace roughly in the middle of the hall, centered on the width but about 30 feet from the upper-end wall and a little farther from the other end. The hall was damaged by bombs and fire during the Second World War, but not seriously, and with the exception of the removal of the fireplace and construction of a second oriel window opposite the first, it looks very much as it did in Sh.’s day, though the screen does not certainly date from before 1594.</p>

<p>Gray’s Inn mounted an elaborate revels lasting with breaks from about 12 Dec. 1594 to Shrove Tuesday 1595, when a final masque was performed before the queen at court. Sometime after 20 Dec., certainly by 28 Dec., until about 4 Jan., a stage and scaffolds (bleachers) were erected in the hall, and for an unknown period an elevated chair of state for the prince of the revels was placed on the half-pace. At his enthronement on 20 Dec., <quote>The Prince, with all his Train in Order&hellip;took his place in his Throne, under a rich Cloth of State: His Counsellors and great Lords were placed about him, and before him; below the Half-pace, at a Table, sate his learned Council and Lawyers</quote> (<title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>, the account of the revels, ed. Bland, 1968, p. 13).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994 #b_nela1992"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref> (1992 and 1994) shows that college halls likewise employed scaffolds ranged along the walls, above the screen in the gallery, and sometimes against the upper-end wall overlooking the stage. Performances in these halls were on a stage that covered the dais, not apparently the way Gray’s Inn hall was configured, but otherwise useful for comparison. The timbers that transformed the halls into theaters were used over a period of many years, put up and taken down whenever occasion demanded. Plays had been performed at Gray’s Inn—<title level="m">Jocasta</title> and <title level="m">Supposes</title> in 1566 and <title level="m">The Misfortunes of Arthur</title> perhaps in 1587—so Gray’s may have had what Nelson calls a demountable stage and seating. At the mock trial following the disaster of overcrowding and near riot on 28 Dec., the <quote>Sorcerer or Conjuror</quote> who had presumably arranged for <title level="m">Err.</title> to be played was charged because <quote>he had caused the Stage to be built, and Scaffolds to be reared to the top of the House, to increase Expectation</quote> (<title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>, ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 32, 70). This charge could either point to a new construction—very expensive—or, considering <quote><hi rend="italic">the</hi> Stage,</quote> not <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Stage, to the erection of a demountable one. In any event, the stage and scaffolding were taken down on the command of the (p. 70) <quote>Readers and Ancients of the House, by reason of the Term,</quote> to free up space the lawyers and students needed for eating.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_knam1984"><name type="app">Knapp</name> &amp; <name type="app">Kobialka</name></ref> (1984) believe that the stage was erected in the space between the half-pace and the fireplace, a stage (p. 77) <quote>about nine feet deep and as wide as the hall, that is, thirty-four feet, eight inches.</quote> This is a depth close to the 10′2″ at Queen’s (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref>, 1994, p. 29) but quite shallow. Nelson judges that the stages in Cambridge were six feet high, but might vary from hall to hall. The space in front of the stage between the fireplace and the hall screen, with the scaffolding aligned along both sides, was left open for the frequent dancing that formed part of the revelry. Such a position for the stage meant that at least half the audience saw the play from the rear, though the height of the scaffolding where they sat (<quote>to the top of the House</quote>) improved sight lines; besides, actors were accustomed to playing to three or four sides of the public stage. Entrance to the stage could be through the door at the right rear of the half-pace, though actors would have to squeeze past the audience seated around the prince; or through the doors in the screen, forcing them to walk half the length of the hall and climb to the stage. Or they might wait in the tiring houses described below, if Gray’s Inn had such structures. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hotl1954"><name type="app">Hotson</name></ref> (1954, facing p. 136) has a reconstruction of Whitehall that anticipates Knapp &amp; Kolbialka in some features, especially the staging in the middle of the hall and the use of the bleachers.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mahm2000"><name type="app">Mahood</name></ref> (2000, p. 36) favors entrances and exits at the dais end.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref> (1994, p. 108) demonstrates that cloth <quote>houses</quote> were used on the Cambridge stages, sometimes in <quote>clearly facing pairs.</quote> He also shows (pp. 24–9) that the Queen’s and Trinity College stages had tiring houses integrated into the stage at the left and right ends, <quote>straightforward three-storey structures,</quote> measuring (Queen’s) 11′2″ by 4′8″. Something similar seems to have characterized the Gray’s Inn stage. On 3 Jan. another large company gathered to be entertained. <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 35–6): <quote part="I">When they were all thus placed and setled in very good Order, the Prince came into the Hall [from the screen end] with his wonted State, and ascended his Throne at the high End of the Hall, under His Highness’s Arms; and after him came the Ambassador of <hi rend="italic">Templaria</hi>, with his Train likewise [and were duly seated]. Then, after variety of Musick, they were presented with this Device.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">At the side of the Hall, behind a Curtain, was erected an Altar to the Goddess of Amity; her Arch-Flamen, ready to attend the Sacrifice and Incense that should, by her Servants, be offered unto her: Round about the same sate Nymphs and Fairies, with Instruments of Musick, and made very pleasant Melody with Viols and Voices, and sang Hymns and Praises to her Deity.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Then issued forth of another Room the first pair of Friends&hellip;[who] offered Incense upon the Altar to [<hi rend="italic">36</hi>] their Goddess.</quote> Those two Friends, as they are called in <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>, are followed by eight more characters in the masque, which celebrates the renewed friendship of Gray’s Inn and the Inner Temple. At each side of the hall, behind curtains, there must have been enough space to enclose at least ten masquers. The oriel window on the north side of the half-pace juts out 4′7″, running from the floor to midway up the wall; it would suggest itself as an acting space save that it is an extension of the dais, where the dignitaries are seated, and it lacks its counterpart across the dais on the south side.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kerg1944"><name type="app">Kernodle</name></ref> (1944, p. 133) describes staging of four plays presented in the Inns of Court, <title level="m">Gorboduc</title> (1561 at the Inner Temple), <title level="m">Jocasta</title> (1566 at Gray’s), <title level="m">Gismond of Salerne</title> (1567 at the Inner Temple), and <title level="m">The Misfortunes of Arthur</title> (1587 perhaps at Gray’s). All four need two side doors and a centered acting space. Of <title level="m">Jocasta</title> he writes: <quote>[It] had the most interesting façade of all&hellip;a façade in the centuries old pattern of a central castle gate flanked by two side doors. Here the central castle was the palace doorway of Jocasta</quote>; and of <title level="m">The Misfortunes of Arthur</title>, produced just seven years before <title level="m">Err</title>: <quote>A complex background even more like the public stage façade was used. Two entranceways&hellip;served as the houses of Mordred and of Arthur&hellip;; and a third entrance is spoken of at one moment as the cloister of the nuns,</quote> reminding us of the abbey in <title level="m">Err.</title> These stages fit well enough with those <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref> describes and offer the same problems of just who got to see what if the plays were staged as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_knam1984"><name type="app">Knapp</name> &amp; <name type="app">Kobialka</name></ref> propose, rather than at one or the other end of the hall, as I think most discussions assume. There is the added fact that now only one door opens to the dais; the east wall has been paneled and I find no evidence that another door used to exist.</p>

<p>At the 300th-anniversary production at Gray’s, 14 Dec. 1895, the stage was set at the screen end, using the two doors. At the 400th anniversary, the stage was set along the lower end of the north wall, the gallery, and the screen—a right-angle set.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hodc0001"><name type="app">Hodges</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam4"><name type="app">Dorsch</name></ref>, ed. 1988, p. 27) illustrates a stage built over the dais. The throne for the revels prince is on stage at the right, surrounded by courtiers, and another group of courtiers is opposite; the action of the play takes place in the constricted remainder of the stage. At the rear of the stage is an arras hiding the tiring house and at the front are steps leading from the floor of the hall to the stage, which is about three feet high.</p>

<p>Using the same illustration, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hodc1999"><name type="app">Hodges</name></ref> (1999, p. 150) says of the lock-out scene: <quote>Though this may be staged in any number of fanciful ways, in fact the only article of scenery that is really needed&hellip;is the door itself. It should be remembered that the Chamberlain’s Men had mounted this play at Gray’s Inn at very short notice. With no time at all to make special arrangements, I suggest they simply brought themselves and their costumes with one property door across from Bankside to Gray’s Inn, and with only the clearing of some space on the stage everything was thus ready for them. For this scene, on cue, two of their tire men carried in and held the door as needed.</quote> His solution is very attractive but, as he admits, he has reduced the number of spectators on stage from those implied in <title level="m">Gesta</title> (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0044"/>) and has retained, in front of the dais, the table, which almost certainly was removed. Hodges does not address the <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_knam1984"><name type="app">Knapp</name> &amp; <name type="app">Kobialka</name></ref> proposal.</p>

<p>In illustrating the stages in Cambridge University colleges, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref> (1994, pp. 17, 41) apparently shows the dais as covered by the stage, but he says only that the stages were <quote>near</quote> the upper end of the hall.</p>

<p>The interest in these structures lies particularly in how to stage the lock-out of E. Antipholus in Act 3 and the entry into and return from the abbey in Act 5. Fabric houses arranged across the stage would block the view of that part of audience seated below the raised stage unless the houses were set up as <quote>clearly facing pairs</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1994"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref>, 1994, p. 108) at the ends of the stage. Perhaps such structures could be semipermanent features of the demountable stage. Tiring houses fitted with doors and possibly windows on an upper level would answer many questions about staging those two scenes.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0015-a"/>
<p>It used to be thought that plays might be staged using the screen as a tiring–house facade. But <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nela1992"><name type="app">Nelson</name></ref> (1992, pp. 69–70) makes these objections: <quote part="I">First, halls of all kinds were constructed with social hierarchies in mind. Normally, the higher orders sat at the higher end, the lower orders at the lower end. The logical place for performances was the space just in front of or at the sides of the high table. A performance at the lower end of the hall would be less accessible to the head of household and to guests seated on the dais at the upper end of the hall, and might well be thought to violate proprieties.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Second, the screens served as the principal entrance to the hall [<hi rend="italic">70</hi>] for the majority of guests, especially those of lower rank. Staging a play hard against the screens would either block this normal means of access and egress, or would restrict the stage platform to the width of the space between the doors. Further, a platform erected in front of the screen doors not only might block the normal swing of the doors, but would take an inch from the height of the door opening for every inch of the height of the stage. A five-foot stage would require a ten-foot door to make a five-foot entrance.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Third, hall screens in late Tudor times were ornately decorated: it is difficult to believe that they were routinely and deliberately subjected to the hard use virtually inevitable in the course of a dramatic performance.</quote></p>
<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0015-b"/>
  
<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam4"><name type="app">Dorsch</name></ref> (ed. 1988, pp. 23–4), believing that there were <quote>five handsome arched doorways</quote> in the screen, proposes a staging at the screen end (p. 24): <quote>The three inner doors&hellip;would have served admirably as the entrances to the houses of Antipholus and the Courtesan, and to the priory. The two outer doors could well have been left open to represent the ways leading to the port and the city.</quote> Gray’s Inn hall screen has, however, always had just two doors (and it is not certain that the present screen was in place in 1594 [<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_capl1988"><name type="app">Caplan</name></ref>, 1988]). Dorsch’s proposal is wholly accepted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_riew1990"><name type="app">Riehle</name></ref> (1990, p. 21) and provisionally accepted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gura2000"><name type="app">Gurr</name> &amp; <name type="app">Ichikawa</name></ref> (2000, pp. 102–3). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mahm2000"><name type="app">Mahood</name></ref> (2000, p. 55 n.) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ichm2002"><name type="app">Ichikawa</name></ref> (2002, p. 168 n.) confirm that the screen has always had two doors.</p>

<p>Once one has hypothesized about staging under the unusual circumstances at Gray’s Inn, a question arises about what Sh. had in mind when he conceived the play, and this is a question that is connected to the unsettled question of when he wrote it. His casting of the play, including the characters he added to Plautus’s play, argues that he knew what resources he had available to him. If he wrote <title level="m">Err.</title> specifically for its first performance at Gray’s Inn in 1594, counting on staging methods (including three <quote>houses</quote>) that would allow him a classical flavor, then the report in <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> that the performance was huddled together at a moment’s notice is a palpable fiction (which it may indeed be). <title level="m">Err.</title> was also played at court in 1604, and most likely in the public playhouses. Elizabethan staging was nothing if not flexible, but in what follows scholars openly or implicitly choose only one of the alternatives.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1922, pp. 81–2, 98): <quote>The chief difficulty&hellip;is to determine the relative positions of the Mart and the house of Antipholus. At times they seem some distance apart, at times they are close together, if not in the same locality.&hellip;We have come to the conclusion that the most satisfactory arrangement for a modern reader’s text is to alternate between two localities: (i) an open space before the house of Antipholus, which will have the priory on one side and a street-exit on the other, and (ii) the Mart, which will have the Courtesan’s house in the centre and street-exits, one of them leading to the bay, on either side. We believe too that those responsible for the text, as we have it, kept those two localities more or less in mind, distinguishing them at the time of performance by means of placards, when necessary. Evidently the play was to be acted upon a simple platform with three doors at the back, and no inner-stage.</quote> He goes through the scenes, showing what placards would have to be erected. <quote>Possibly the three doors&hellip;were simply the entrances to the painted <quote>houses</quote> which are known to have been used on the academic and court stage; [<hi rend="italic">82</hi>] but it is not necessary to our argument to suppose this, since the bare dais of a hall, with three doors at the back, would serve.&hellip;The obvious necessity for an upper-stage in 3.1., a scene which must have lost much of its effect when played in a hall without a gallery&hellip;suggest[s] that [Sh.] had the ordinary Elizabethan stage in mind throughout.</quote> (P. 98, on <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0679">679</ref>): <quote>In a public playhouse, for which this scene is clearly arranged, S. Dromio would be <quote>within</quote> i.e. behind the door or curtain at the back of the inner-stage, while Luce and Adriana would appear on the balcony which overhangs the inner-stage. All previous edd. have placed the two women <quote>within</quote> with S. Dromio. Such an arrangement is extremely awkward from the theatrical point of view, since the audience would be greatly puzzled by three unseen characters, more especially as one of them appears nowhere else in the play. Luce and Adriana, on the upper-stage, could be seen by the audience without themselves seeing E. Dromio and E. Antipholus, who would be at the door out of sight under the balcony. On the other hand at a performance such as that at Gray’s Inn&hellip;where no inner-stage and probably no balcony would be available, the three characters would have to be <quote>within.</quote></quote> Gray’s Inn hall has a balcony over the screen end, but Wilson seems to envision the dais as the stage. Gray’s Inn hall has only a single door opening to the dais.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:307–8): <quote>Probably the stage was set in the same way throughout. At the back of the stage three houses or doors represented to the right and left the Priory with some religious emblem over it, and the Courtesan’s house with the sign of the Porpentine, and in the centre the house of Antipholus with the sign of the Phoenix. As Wilson [ed. 1922, p. 98] points out, Adriana [<hi rend="italic">308</hi>] and Luce must here appear <quote>above</quote> in iii. I. There is no other action above and none within; all is either at the doors of the houses, or in an open place, often referred to as the <quote>mart.</quote> The mart scenes were played at the front of the stage, and the side entrances were supposed to lead to the bay and to the town respectively. But while characters sometimes seem to move direct from the mart to the houses, there are also passages which suggest that they go off the stage on the way between these. Such inconsistencies would probably not be much felt in a bustling action.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alep1939"><name type="app">Alexander</name></ref> (1939, pp. 68–9), arguing that Sh. did not have the Elizabethan stage in mind, but rather that of classic convention: <quote>One side entrance leads to the Bay, the other to the Town. This was the proper classic setting for the stage, since the Comedy, which was Shakespeare’s model, was born at Athens between [<hi rend="italic">69</hi>] the Bay and the Town. And the courtesy of convention allowed Comedy to enjoy the advantages she was born to, even in cities where they were unsanctioned by the laws of nature. Plautus in his <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> gives a harbour to Thebes.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew1954"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1942; 1954, p. 140): <quote>In <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> the remarkable directions <quote>from the Courtezan’s,</quote> <quote>from the Bay,</quote> <quote>to the Priory,</quote> <quote>to the Abbess</quote> point clearly to a set stage with three houses and entrances between. The play cannot therefore have been written for the public theatre, and in fact the earliest recorded performance was on 28 Dec. 1594 at Gray’s Inn.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, pp. xxxiv ff.): <quote part="I"><title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is unique among Shakespeare’s plays in the way localities are indicated&hellip;; it seems to require only four playing-areas, or at the most five, three of which were clearly marked by signs [i.e., placards]. These localities are the <quote>street</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0659">659</ref>] etc.) or <quote>mart</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0239">239</ref>], etc.), presumably the main playing area of the stage; the house of Antipholus of Ephesus, called the Phoenix ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0240">240</ref>]); the house of the Courtesan, called the Porpentine (i.e. Porcupine, [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0777">777</ref>]); and the Priory which houses the Abbess ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1502">1502</ref>]). It is possible that an upper storey or gallery in the house of Antipholus was also used ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0603">603</ref>&hellip;; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0679">679</ref>]), [<hi rend="italic">xxxv</hi>] but is not essential to the play’s action. The evidence of the text points to one conclusion [he quotes <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> on the three houses].&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The text indicates a continuous action on a stage with three fixed locations, which could have been <quote>houses,</quote> shallow structures from which characters could speak or make entries. The use of <quote>houses</quote>&hellip;was common in Court productions, and standard practice in the dramaturgy of Lyly, from whom Shakespeare learned much in writing his play. However, Shakespeare may also have had in mind the traditions of Gray’s Inn, if <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> was written for performance there. For the educated gentlemen of the Inns of Court were familiar with the conventionalized arcade setting with which Renaissance editors illustrated editions of Terence and Plautus, apparently in the belief that they were imitating the Roman stage. In these arcades, each compartment would represent a house or <quote>domus,</quote> and it seems that staging at the Inns of Court followed this pattern [quotes <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kerg1944"><name type="app">Kernodle</name></ref>, above].&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">xxxvi</hi>] All these [plays] had three fixed locations, and an arcade with three doors such as that used for <title level="m">Jocasta</title> and possibly for <title level="m">The Misfortunes of Arthur</title> would have served admirably for <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, which seems to call for exactly this kind of setting.</quote></p>

<p>He quotes <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alep1939"><name type="app">Alexander</name></ref> (above). <quote part="I">This is a reasonable suggestion, but I do not think we need suppose that Shakespeare had read Vitruvius, or realized what was a <quote>proper classic setting</quote>; his reading of Plautus would have been enough, for <title level="m">Menaechmi</title> and <title level="m">Amphitruo</title> clearly indicate a harbour and a city.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">However, the indications in stage-directions and within the text all suggest a simple staging of a special kind. It is tempting to suppose that this short play, with its classical background, was designed for performance in a hall with no gallery, and for an audience used to <quote>houses</quote> on stage, and perhaps familiar with the [<hi rend="italic">xxxvii</hi>] kind of arcade setting to be seen in several editions of Terence.</quote></p>

<p>He quotes <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>, but observes that notions of Elizabethan staging have become simplified since 1922—an overhanging balcony and an inner stage with door at the rear are no longer believed to have existed. He wonders whether one or more stage doors <quote>included a wicket or aperture in the upper part, as seems to be suggested by the jesting cry of Dromio of Syracuse to his [<hi rend="italic">xxxviii</hi>] twin, <quote>Either get thee from this door, or sit down at the hatch</quote> ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0655">655</ref>]&hellip;). The aperture may have been a half-door, or at least large enough for several figures to be visible to the audience, and Luce certainly appears from the dialogue to be located within the door&hellip;[quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0692">692</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0698">698</ref>]. In addition, there is little evidence for the use of a gallery here; at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0603" targetEnd="#tln_0604">603–4</ref>] Adriana says

<quote rend="block">Husband, I’ll dine above with you to-day,
<lb/>And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks,</quote>

but it is doubtful whether this can be taken literally as referring to the stage.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">xxxix</hi>] It seems to me that Luce and Adriana are meant to be visible to the audience in this scene, while apparently, or in supposition, remaining concealed from Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions, and that this could be more easily and convincingly staged by using a structure on stage than by placing the mistress and her maid on a balcony.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kina1988"><name type="app">Kinney</name></ref> (1988, p. 44) believes that one of the three doors has the sign of the Centaur over it, and he misrepresents <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1930"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref>: <quote>But the priory cannot be the same doorway as the Phoenix as previous critics claim, beginning with E.

<p>Two essays speak about the conceptual significance of the staging.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_broh1961"><name type="app">Brooks</name></ref> (1961, p. 70): <quote>The development of the action is supported by the use made of the stage-set. Acts II and III are focused upon the Phoenix, scene of the central crisis. Act IV brings into play the second <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">domus</foreign>, the Porpentine, and in accord with the fast-extending complications has no one focal point: the action is related by turns to the Phoenix, the Porpentine, and neither. The third <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">domus</foreign>, the Abbey, is kept in reserve as the appropriate focus for the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">dénouement</foreign>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bevd1984"><name type="app">Bevington</name></ref> (1984, pp. 108–9): <quote part="I">If we turn to neoclassic tradition [from Tudor drama and royal and civic entertainment]&hellip;with its emphasis on ambiguity and surprise, we find Shakespeare using the stage façade to frame a world of illusion, escape, and rebellion against authority.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">If, as seems likely, Shakespeare began his exploration of such liminal spatial relationships in <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, his indebtedness to neoclassic theater is clear enough. In modified form he seems to have [<hi rend="italic">109</hi>] adopted the model set forth in <title level="m">Ralph Roister Doister</title> and <title level="m">Gammer Gurton’s Needle</title>, for example, where two or more houses face on a street scene throughout the play. Shakespeare evidently intends one stage door to represent the dwelling of Antipholus of Ephesus throughout, with the Abbey near at hand and represented by another door. What attracts Shakespeare to such a setting is not the verisimilar scenic effect—there is no indication that scenery or stage housing was used in the original production—but rather the spatial interconnection of the main stage and the space lying within. The stage façade becomes a part of Shakespeare’s comedy of illusion and misunderstanding, much as it must have done on Plautus’ and Terence’s stage before him. Antipholus of Ephesus arrives at one point to find his house door—presumably a door in the tiring-house façade—locked against him. He and his servant&hellip;call in vain to those in the house, who speak apparently from within. When Luce and then Adriana <quote>enter</quote> and yet are presumed to be still inside the house, they may be visible to the audience as they stand in the gallery or some such acting area, out of sight of the frustrated master and his servant on the main stage ([<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0680" targetEnd="#tln_0705">680–705</ref>]). The façade thus expresses misunderstanding and inversion between husband and wife and between servant and servant; it is a device of complication.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Later in the play&hellip;this same façade becomes the means of revelation and discovery. It is through the stage door representing the Abbey that the Abbess emerges with Antipholus and Dromio of Syracusa to undeceive all those who have begun to question their own sanity. The actors’ tiring-house contains all secrets and eventually explains all mysteries; with its two or more doors, it is at once the source of comic confusion and eventual clarification. The apertures into the façade are not, on Shakespeare’s illusionistic stage, simply a means of allowing characters to appear from and disappear into an understood offstage location; they stress a duality between what is seen and unseen, between what a character supposes to be within and what in fact is to be found there. The stage façade is an essential source of illusion in the liminal world of Shakespeare’s first comedy of mistaken identities.</quote></p>

<p>Many object to the unacceptable improbability of identical twins: <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_brau1979"><name type="app">Bräker</name></ref> (1780; tr. 1979, p. 51): Adriana is <quote>deaf, and idiotic into the bargain, to insist that another man was [her] husband</quote>; similarly <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dupp1828"><name type="app">Duport</name></ref> (1828, 2:266). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_scha1815"><name type="app">Schlegel</name></ref> (1809–11; tr. 1815, 2:158): <quote>In such pieces we must, to give to the senses at least an appearance of truth, always pre-suppose that the parts by which the misunderstandings are occasioned are played with masks, and this the poet no doubt observed.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_flef1876"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref> (1876, p. 25): <quote>It is seldom acted, the extreme difficulty of obtaining two pairs of actors sufficiently like to realize the <quote>errors</quote> enough for modern taste being insurmountable.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_knic1849"><name type="app">Knight</name></ref> (1849, p. 117) disagrees with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hazw1817"><name type="app">Hazlitt</name></ref>, though he confesses never to have seen the play: <quote>It appears to us that every one of an <hi rend="italic">audience</hi>&hellip;who keeps his eyes open, will, after he has become a little familiar with the persons of [the two sets of twins], find out some clue by which he can detect a difference between each.</quote> He quotes <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_scha1815"><name type="app">Schlegel</name></ref> above on masks. <quote>Whether masks, properly so called, were used in Shakspere’s time in the representation of this play, we have some doubt.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_haic1978"><name type="app">Haines</name></ref> (1978, p. 109) worries about just how identically the twins are to be costumed: <quote>If they are dressed identically, the other characters are at least partially justified in their mistakes and confusions (although it is not easy to justify a wife’s failing to recognize her own husband at intimate range); but, too, if they are dressed identically (and two sets of actors have been found who will prove indistinguishable), the audience will themselves be confused for at least a part of the evening.

<p>1594<space extent="1em"/>Gray’s Inn and <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>. The first recorded performance of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is that at Gray’s Inn on 28 Dec., Holy Innocents’ Day, 1594, recorded in the <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>, which was published in 1688. In May and June 1594 the Admiral’s men and the Chamberlain’s men were formed to make some order out of the chaotic playing conditions caused in part by the extended closure of the London acting houses during the plague of mid 1592–mid 1594. The Admiral’s company played at court on 28 Dec. (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae1923"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>, 1923, 4:109), freeing Sh.’s company, themselves at court on the two previous nights, to play at Gray’s Inn. <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> implies that the actors were called on the spur of the moment to calm what looked to be turning into a riot. If so, what good fortune to have a short Plautine comedy at hand. Here is the report of the event (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 29–34): <quote>The next grand Night was intended to be upon <hi rend="italic">Innocents-Day</hi> at Night; at which time there was a great Presence of Lords, Ladies, and worshipful Personages, that did expect some notable Performance at that time; which, indeed, had been effected, if the multitude of Beholders had not been so exceeding great, that thereby there was no convenient room for those that were Actors; by reason whereof, very good Inventions and Conceipts could not have opportunity to be applauded, which otherwise would have been great Contentation to the Beholders.</quote> About 9:00 p.m. the Inner Temple sent an ambassador with a large entourage to pay a formal visit to the mock prince of Purpoole, Henry Helmes, a law student, and was conducted to a (p. 30) <quote>Chair besides His Highness, to the end that he might be Partaker of the Sports intended.</quote> Polite speeches followed, emphasizing the long friendship between the Temple and Gray’s Inn.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0044">(P. 31): <quote>When the Ambassador was placed, as aforesaid, and that there was something to be performed for the Delight of the Beholders, there arose such a disordered Tumult and Crowd upon the Stage, that there was no Opportunity to effect that which was intended: There came so great a number of worshipful Personages upon the Stage, that might not be displaced; and Gentlewomen, whose Sex did privilege them from Violence, that when the Prince and his Officers had in vain, a good while, expected and endeavoured a Reformation, at length there was no hope of Redress for that present. The Lord Ambassador and his Train thought that they were not so kindly entertained, as was before expected, and thereupon would not stay any longer at that time, but, in a sort, discontented and displeased. After their Departure the Throngs and Tumults did somewhat cease, although so much of them continued, as was able to disorder and confound any good Inventions whatsoever. In regard whereof, as also for that the Sports intended were especially for the gracing of the <hi rend="italic">Templarians</hi>, it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, [<hi rend="italic">32</hi>] saving Dancing and Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> his <title level="m">Menechmus</title>) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, <title level="m">The Night of Errors</title>.</quote></p>

<p>The uproar led the <quote>Lawyers of the Prince’s Council</quote> to set up a mock court of inquiry concerning <quote part="I">some great Disorders and Abuses lately done and committed with[in] his Highness’s Dominions of <hi rend="italic">Purpoole</hi>, especially by Sorceries and Inchantments; and namely, of a great Witchcraft used the Night before, whereby there were great Disorders and Misdemeanours, by Hurly-burlies, Crowds, Errors, Confusions, vain Representations and Shews, to the utter Discredit of our State and Policy.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The next Night upon this Occasion, we preferred Judgments thick and threefold, which were read publickly by the Clerk of the Crown, being all against a Sorcerer or Conjurer that was supposed to be the Cause of that confused Inconvenience. Therein was contained, How he had caused the Stage to be built, and Scaffolds to be reared to the top of the House, to increase Expectation.</quote> He is also charged with inviting throngs to the party, disgracing the Templars, and disappointing them of the expected entertainments. <quote>Also that he caused Throngs and Tumults, [<hi rend="italic">33</hi>] Crowds and Outrages, to disturb our whole Proceedings. And Lastly, that he had foisted a Company of base and common Fellows, to make up our Disorders with a Play of Errors and Confusions; and that that Night had gained to us Discredit, and it self a Nickname of Errors. All which were against the Crown and Dignity of our Sovereign Lord, the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Purpoole</hi>.</quote></p>

<p>The prisoner was allowed to make a petition explaining his actions, <quote>wherein was a Disclosure of all the Knavery and Juggling of the Attorney and Sollicitor, which had brought all this Law-stuff on purpose to blind the Eyes of his Excellency, and all the honourable Court there, going about to make them think, that those things which they all saw and perceived sensibly to be in very deed done, and actually performed, were nothing else but vain Illusions, Fancies, Dreams and Enchantments, and to be wrought and [<hi rend="italic">34</hi>] compassed by the Means of a poor harmless Wretch, that never had heard of such great Matters in all his Life: Whereas the very Fault was in the Negligence of the Prince’s Council, Lords and Officers of his State, that had the Rule of the Roast, and by whose Advice the Commonwealth was so soundly mis-governed.</quote> He makes irrefutable countercharges against the grandees. <quote part="I">But the Prince and States-men (being pinched on both sides, by both the Parties) were not a little offended at the great Liberty that they had taken, in censuring so far of His Highness’s Government; and thereupon the Prisoner was freed and pardoned, the Attorney, Sollicitor, Master of Requests, and those that were acquainted with the Draught of the Petition, were all of them commanded to the Tower; so the Lieutenant took charge of them. And this was the End of our Law-sports, concerning the Night of Errors.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0046"><quote part="F">When we were wearied with mocking thus at our own Follies, at length there was a great Consultation had for the Recovery of our lost Honour.</quote> Plans are made to perform divers plots and devices on 3 Jan., with provisions made to keep out gate crashers and otherwise to ensure order.</p>

<p>How to understand these events? On 28 Dec. a <quote>notable Performance</quote> was made impossible because <quote>worshipful Personages</quote> and <quote>Gentlewomen</quote> invaded the specially erected stage to such a degree that <quote>there was no convenient room for those that were Actors</quote>; the Templarian guests took offense and departed; order was mostly restored, and dancing and reveling, followed by a performance of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, were substituted, substitutions that were <quote>not&hellip;any thing of Account</quote> in comparison to what had been planned. The <quote>Actors</quote> seem not to be the same as <quote>the Players,</quote> later called a <quote>Company of base and common Fellows,</quote> though it is just possible that the <quote>notable Performance</quote> was <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title>, not substituted but merely delayed until the rather small stage could be cleared for performance (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_smib1997"><name type="app">Smith</name></ref> [1997, p. 102]: <quote>The first recorded performance&hellip;almost didn’t happen</quote>). The embarrassment caused by the near riot led to the events of the succeeding days.</p>

<p>Is <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> an eyewitness report of an event that went badly wrong, leading to ad hoc substitutions of wholly different, planned entertainments, followed the next day by a hastily convened arraignment and trial of someone who was to blame for not controlling the evening better and for having, without planning, assembled the Lord Chamberlain’s men, well after 9 p.m., to play <title level="m">Err.</title> on what was perhaps an unfamiliar stage with no opportunity for familiarizing themselves with the physical attributes of that stage? Or is the whole account a fiction, one that pretends there was such mismanagement and such good fortune, followed by a mock arraignment and freeing of the prisoner? No one has put <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> under much scrutiny, though <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_quia1922"><name type="app">Quiller-Couch</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3a"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>, ed. 1922, p. x) doubts that its account is trustworthy: <quote>We doubt then that it [the ad hoc substitution of <title level="m">Err.</title>] was a makeshift: we suspect rather that it was pre-arranged; that the players had been pre-empted from Greenwich to present just such an extravaganza upon Plautus as would tickle the scholarly taste and amuse the <quote>serious lawyers</quote> amid their bowers.</quote> The reference to Greenwich alludes to a probably mistaken report of payment to the Chamberlain’s men for a performance at court on 28 Dec. 1594; see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0009"/>.

Bland), p. 114: <quote>I suspect that the truth lies somewhere between the arranged and the completely spontaneous.&hellip;Specific interruptions might indeed arise spontaneously, but the patterns they assumed [<hi rend="italic">115</hi>] were derived from previously existing social arrangements they then both reflected and modified.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_smib1997"><name type="app">Smith</name></ref> (1997, pp. 103, 108, 118): <quote part="I">Reinserted into the social context in which it was given its first recorded performance, <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> offers itself as a particularly revealing document about what it meant to be male—for one privileged group of men, at least—in early modern England.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">108</hi>] <quote part="F">Whether or not <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> was written specifically for performance at Gray’s Inn has been the subject of philological inquiry for some time. From the standpoint of cultural anthropology, however, it doesn’t really matter which is the chicken and which the egg. More important is the fact that <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and the <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> that occasioned its first recorded performance constitute&hellip;a single piece of social process.</quote> He studies the two documents to show them as describing a rite of passage involving such matters as adolescent anxieties about identity, the emphasis in both on sexuality, and adult assurances, including (p. 118) <quote>in the end, both play and pageants find a place for women that supports rather than threatens male identity.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kina1999"><name type="app">Kinney</name></ref> (1999, pp. 321, 323), commenting on <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>: <quote>This passage [quoted from pp. 31–2 above] has long been interpreted as a factual account&hellip;; but there is at least another reading possible: that Confusion was the theme and the whole evening performed as planned.</quote> He suggests that the play is (p. 323) <quote>itself a mixture of the pagan and the Christian. And this is true, in turn, because it comes out of a profoundly unsettled cultural moment,</quote> the time of transition between abandoning Catholicism, when the mystery plays continued to be performed in the face of official opposition, and embracing a secular worldview, as evidenced in the secular drama.</p>

<p>The first suspicious element is the one just alluded to, getting an acting company assembled late at night on the spur of the moment. How would the actors have been rounded up? They had probably played in the afternoon on the public stage, if not in fact at Greenwich, and had played at court the two preceding nights as well; they would be tired and dispersed. Supposing they were assembled, could they perform <title level="m">Err.</title> on an unfamiliar stage, by all estimates an odd one (see Staging) erected near the middle of Gray’s Inn hall? The difficult scenes to stage, of E. Antipholus locked out and the exiting and reentrance of S. Antipholus, S. Dromio, and the Abbess in Act 5, would call for some familiarity with that stage. Next, the vocabulary used to account for the mishaps—<quote>Sorceries and Inchantments&hellip;Witchcraft&hellip;Sorcerer or Conjuror</quote>—closely mirrors that of <title level="m">Err.</title>, as does the surprising coincidence of <quote>being pinched on both sides</quote> with its possible glance at Doctor Pinch. If <title level="m">Err.</title> influences <title level="m">Gesta</title>—and no one knows how long after Shrovetide 1595 the latter was written—could a single performance have had such an effect on the writer? (Of course, he might have seen <title level="m">Err.</title> later, as often as it was played.) Were the Gray’s Inn members as humiliated by the disgraceful goings on as they say? Did they cover that embarrassment by quickly setting up a court to interrogate the Sorcerer? Had they not planned anything for 29 Dec.? Did they really decide after that trial to have a next grand night on 3 Jan., when an elaborate masque was presented (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0046"/>)? Such performances take great planning. Granted that the report sounds authentic as it describes the Night of Errors and its immediate consequences, it does not square with the extremely elaborate, very expensive planning that the first words of <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title> (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 5–6) describe: <quote part="I">The great number of gallant Gentlemen that <hi rend="italic">Grays-Inn</hi> afforded at ordinary Revels, betwixt <hi rend="italic">All-hollontide</hi> [1 Nov.] and <hi rend="italic">Christmas</hi>, exceeding therein the rest of the Houses of Court, gave occasion to some Well-willers of our Sports&hellip;to wish an Head answerable to so noble a Body, and a Leader to so gallant a Company: Which Motion was more willingly hearkened unto, in regard that such Pass-times had been intermitted by the space of three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances.</quote></p>

<p>[<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] <quote part="F">After many Consultations had hereupon, by the Youths, and others that were most forward herein, at length, about the 12th of <hi rend="italic">December</hi>&hellip;it was determined, that there should be elected a Prince of <hi rend="italic">Purpoole</hi>, to govern our State for the time; which was intended to be for the Credit of <hi rend="italic">Grays Inn</hi>, and rather to be performed by witty Inventions, than chargeable Expences.</quote> But the expenses were high, causing a levy on the members (and getting ten pounds from an alumnus, Lord Treasurer William Cecil).</p>

<p>An alternative is to say this was all scripted, including a near riot that did not occur, a display of Templarian anger that never happened, and a planned performance of <title level="m">Err.</title> to an audience so suitable for it that many have proposed that the play was written for Gray’s Inn (though not necessarily for these revels, which seem to have been determined on only some two weeks before it was played). There is some allure to the notion that Sh. wrote the play especially for these revels, for then the appearance of the Chamberlain’s men is most easily accounted for. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thos1956"><name type="app">Thomas</name></ref> (1956, pp. 380–1) makes the most closely reasoned case for such an occasional composition (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0025"/>), though like others who argue that <title level="m">Err.</title> was written for Gray’s, he does not mention the apparently impromptu nature of the events recorded in <title level="m">Gesta Grayorum</title>.</p>

<p>The contemporary influence of <title level="m">Err.</title> was sufficient to encourage the anonymous author of <title level="m">The Birth of Hercules</title>, a version of Plautus’s <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>, to include a witty servant named Dromio. The date of this manuscript play is uncertain, but on the basis of watermarks cannot be before 1597 (ed. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_theb1911">Bond</ref>, 1911, p. v). Bond goes on to say (pp. x f.), <quote>The <title level="m">Birth of Hercules</title> is a pretty close adaptation, or even translation, of the <title level="m">Amphitruo</title>&hellip;increased in bulk nearly one third by the addition of the second servant, Dromio [etc.]&hellip;additions probably suggested by the <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title>.</quote> Dromio is a second servant (with Sosia) of Amphitruo, sent by the returning master to tell Alcmena he is coming home, hence interrupting Jupiter’s night with her. Dromio has been delayed by a tempest that nearly wrecked his ship, another detail possibly suggested by <title level="m">Err.</title></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (ed. 1962, p. lii), who notes <title level="m">The Birth of Hercules</title>, adds <title level="m">How a Man may choose a Good Wife from a Bad</title> (1602): <quote>This comedy has among its characters a thin schoolmaster called Aminadab, who is described in terms that recall Antipholus’s depiction of Doctor Pinch [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1714" targetEnd="#tln_1718">1714–18</ref>].</quote> Quoted here differently from Foakes: <quote>When didst thou see the starueling School-maister?

Evans (p. 6) allows the possibility that a provincial touring company, drawn from Nursery and King’s company players, might have used the prompt copy as late as 1672. Three actors, John Coysh (E.

<p>1762<space extent="1em"/>24 Apr. Covent Garden, London. <title level="m">The Twins, or, A Comedy of Errors</title>. Not published, but presumably the same as the one printed privately in 1770. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hogc1952"><name type="app">Hogan</name></ref> (1957, 2:149): <quote><quote>With Alterations from Shakespeare &lt;by Thomas Hull&gt;.

Bell.</quote> This 1770 edition is Hull’s first version of what would be the form of <title level="m">Err.</title> played into the next century, and while it adds a great deal to and cuts a great deal from <title level="m">Err.</title>, it held the stage for fifty years. Hogan reconstructs the cast (2:150–1): Edward Shuter (E. Dromio); John Dunstall (S. Dromio); Thomas Hull (S. Antipholis—he would soon begin his long career as Ægeon); Davis, stage name of Thomas Dibble (E. Antipholis); Elizabeth Vincent (Adriana); Jane Lessingham (Luciana); and Sarah Ward (Abbess). The Courtesan now becomes Lesbia (Anne Stephens), and Luce becomes Bridget.</p>

<p>1779<space extent="1em"/>22, 27 Jan.; 1, 6, 9, 20 Feb.; 4, 21 May; 29 Oct.; 14 Dec. Covent Garden, London. Hull’s adaptation, but given Sh.’s title. Now Hull began playing Ægeon, W. T. (<quote>Gentleman</quote>) Lewis and John Whitfield played the two Antipholises, John Brunsdon and John Quick the Dromios, Ralph Wewitzer (Pinch), Jane Lessingham (renewing as Luciana after 17 years), Hester Jackson (Adriana), and Elizabeth Hartley (Abbess) (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hogc1952"><name type="app">Hogan</name></ref>, 1952, 1:151). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_odeg1920"><name type="app">Odell</name></ref> (1920, 2:48): <quote>I wish to state that I believe an audience would get more enjoyment from Hull’s (and Kemble’s) Comedy of Errors than from Shakespeare’s,</quote> because Hull’s additions sentimentalized the play, added to the lines of S. Dromio, and allowed Ægeon and the Abbess to rejoice at their reunion.</p>

<p>1780<space extent="1em"/>6 Jan.; 16 May. Covent Garden, London. The cast is as in 1779, save that Mary Whitfield replaced Jane Lessingham.</p>

<p>The play now began to appear regularly at Covent Garden, with performances—sometimes only once a year—in 1781, 1785, 1786, 1788–98.</p>

<p>Lewis continued as S. Antipholis until he was replaced by William Macready in 1790–1, followed by Alexander Pope. E. Antipholis was played by John Whitfield, William Palmer, and John Bernard before Joseph Holman took over the role in 1793. Elizabeth Inchbald was the Abbess from 1785 to 1789, when Charlotte Chapman replaced her.</p>

<p>1793<space extent="1em"/>15 Apr.; 3, 5 June; 8, 26 Oct. Covent Garden, London. The performances of the 1790s (yearly from 1793 to 1798) had Alexander Pope and Joseph Holman as the Antipholises, the very popular Joseph Munden and John Quick as the Dromios, and Hull as Ægeon. Isabella Mattocks played Adriana (also Celia, Cordelia, Hermione, Jessica, suggesting an attractive Adriana).</p>

<p>These Covent Garden performances used Hull’s revised and enlarged text (<quote>A New Edition,</quote> as the title page says); his ed. would be the standard text until Inchbald-Kemble’s in 1808, which made very few changes.</p>

<p>1804<space extent="1em"/>25 May. Park, New York. <title level="m">Err.</title> was first played in New York as an after-piece. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_odeg1927"><name type="app">Odell</name></ref> (1927–49, 3:229) perhaps mistranscribes Ægeon as Ægeus; the Courtesan/Lesbia is chastely named <quote>Hostess.</quote> It is hard to guess what version this represents, but probably Hull’s.</p>

<p>1808<space extent="1em"/>9 Jan. Covent Garden, London. Charles Kemble as E. Antipholis, Charles Murray took over Ægeon following the death of Hull, and William Munden began his S. Dromio role (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_genj1832"><name type="app">Genest</name></ref>, 1832, 8:85). This was a revival by J. P. Kemble after he left Drury Lane; the version he used, Hull’s very slightly modified, was probably the one published in 1808 by Inchbald; she, however, almost certainly had no hand in the text but instead contributed <quote>Remarks,</quote> as the title page says.</p>

<p>1811<space extent="1em"/>17 Apr. Covent Garden, London. Mr. Jones as S. Antipholis, John Brunton as E. Antipholis, Munden as S. Dromio, William Blanchard as E. Dromio. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_genj1832"><name type="app">Genest</name></ref> (1832, 8:233): <quote>Munden acted very well, but he was considerably shorter than Blanchard, and could not well be mistaken for him. Jones and Brunton were well suited.</quote></p>

<p>1823<space extent="1em"/>3 Oct. Covent Garden, London. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_genj1832"><name type="app">Genest</name></ref> (1832, 9:247): <quote>With Katherine and Petruchio [i.e., Garrick’s <title level="m">Shr.</title>],</quote> that is, as an after-piece, but it is impossible to say what version of <title level="m">Err.</title> was used.</p>

<p>1826<space extent="1em"/>25 Oct. Park, New York. James Henry Hackett (E. Dromio); John Barnes (S. Dromio); Lee (S. Antipholis); John Woodhull (E. Antipholis); Mrs. Hackett (Adriana). Barnes and Hackett played the roles for over a decade. Hackett’s specialty was mimicking other actors, and he made his imitation of Barnes the centerpiece of the performances. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_odeg1927"><name type="app">Odell</name></ref> (1927–49, 3:299) wonders whether Hackett ever acted rather than mimicked. The performance was <quote>as adapted to dramatic representation, and performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden</quote>; Odell (3:236) thinks this refers to some version of Reynolds’s 1819 opera, but it is very difficult to know just what was being performed. In any event, the revival was so popular that Hackett delayed his planned trip to England. He later became a famous Falstaff.</p>

<p>1843<space extent="1em"/>26 July. Bowery, New York. W. H. Vache (sometimes <quote>Vaché</quote>) played E. Dromio to E. L. Davenport’s S. Dromio. This pair continued in these roles for several years.</p>

<p>1845<space extent="1em"/>23 Sept. Niblo’s, New York. Thomas Placide (E. Dromio); Henry Placide (S. Dromio). They played this <title level="m">Err.</title> for nearly 20 years. Their prompt-book is analyzed below.</p>

<p>1851<space extent="1em"/>3 Mar. Bowery, New York. Kate Denin played E. Antipholus to her sister Susan’s S. Antipholus.</p>

<p>1853<space extent="1em"/>15 Dec. Burton’s, New York. William Burton (S. Dromio); Andrews (E. Dromio).</p>

<p>1854<space extent="1em"/>18 Apr. Burton’s, New York. Harry Hall (E. Dromio); George Jordan played S. Antipholis to Charles Fisher’s E. Antipholis, a pairing that lasted several years.</p>

<p>1855<space extent="1em"/>8 Nov. Sadler’s Wells, London. Samuel Phelps replaced the Hull-Kemble version and the Reynolds opera (see below) with the authentic play.</p>

<p>1857<space extent="1em"/>21 Jan. Niblo’s, New York. Lizzy Davenport (S. Antipholus) and Olive Logan (E. Antipholus) in one of the Placide brothers productions.</p>

<p>1864<space extent="1em"/>27 Feb. Princess’s Theatre, London. The director, George Vining, played S. Antipholus, and Henry Webb played E. Dromio to his identical twin, Charles’s, S. Dromio.

<p>1864<space extent="1em"/>3 Oct. Winter Garden, New York. This is the Kemble version, since the merchants are named Cleon and Chares; Bridget (Luce-Nell) was played by Mr. Post; Owen Fawcett played E. Dromio. J. S. Clarke (S. Dromio) began his long career in comedy.</p>

<p>1878<space extent="1em"/>25 Nov. Park, New York. Here began the careers of Stuart Robson and W. H. Crane as the Dromios.

<p>1882<space extent="1em"/>26 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon. Edward Compton, director and E. Dromio, William Calvert (E. Antipholus).</p>

<p>1885<space extent="1em"/>7 Sept. Star, New York. W. H.

As for the villa of the courtesan Phryne&hellip;this was a place of tinted marble columns, of embroidered and spangled lace, lamps of perfumed oil, genuine Negroes&hellip;, palms, brilliant flowers, sumptuous couches, singing slaves, and Bacchantes.</quote></p>

<p>1895<space extent="1em"/>6 Dec. Gray’s Inn hall. Elizabethan Stage Society directed by William Poel, who costumed the cast in authentic late Elizabethan dress as part of his program to recapture the original 16th-c. acting and staging values. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sper1954"><name type="app">Speaight</name></ref> (1954, p. 110, with photographs): <quote>The Benchers and their guests sat at their usual places at the long tables, and the actors appeared through the Tudor doors at the lower end of the hall and played on the same level as their audience.

<p>1899<space extent="1em"/>8 June. Terry’s, London. Leon Quartermaine (S. Antipholus); Ben Greet played both Dromios, the earliest example of doubling I have found.</p>

<p>In the 20th c., <title level="m">Err.</title> gets sporadic performance in England and the United States. I mention those that attracted attention in print or had notable performers.</p>

<p>1904<space extent="1em"/>10 Dec. Terry’s, London. Directed by William Poel, with Nugent Monck as Pinch. Poel influenced Monck, who produced <title level="m">Err.</title> in 1919.</p>

<p>1924<space extent="1em"/>1 Sept. Savoy, London. Eric Portman (S. Antipholus). The Dromios were in blackface; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_farh1949"><name type="app">Farjeon</name></ref> (1949, p. 29) objected sharply that Sh. would have let such a feature be known had he intended it.</p>

<p>1963<space extent="1em"/>14 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon. Donald Sinden (Duke Solinus), Clifford Rose (E. Dromio), John Walsh (Aegeon), Janet Suzman (Luciana), Susan Engel (Courtezan), Madoline Thomas (Aemilia). <title level="j">Times</title> (London) (16 Apr., p. 15a): The 1962 production <quote part="I">has mellowed with success, and has lost the original ingredient of anxiety and inward restlessness. Some of the characters now seem aware that there is no problem in this business of mistaken identity, that it is moonshine.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Two new members of the cast, Mr. Donald Sinden as the Duke and Mr. John Walsh as the father of the Antipholuses, certainly suggested this. Since theirs is the first scene, if we overlook the parade of the whole company followed by the <quote>ballet</quote> of figures from some picture of eighteenth-century Venice, the tone set by the Duke and Aegeon is important to the whole. Their scene lacked tension and appeared long drawn out.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The fun and the reality now derived chiefly from the resemblance between the Antipholuses in attitude and temper of mind. Neither knew that he had a double possessing the same mixture of deep-seated complacency and superficial excitability, but we knew it. Soon the mere entrance of one twin was enough to conjure up the thought of the other and in fact absent twin. Mr. Rose by making Dromio of Ephesus the simpler, slower witted of the two servants added something new to the setup. Mr. MacGregor has developed Dromio of Syracuse into a man for all seasons where farce is concerned.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Both the new Luciana (Miss Janet Suzman) and the new Courtezan (Miss Susan Engel) seemed unsure of themselves, but the new Abbess (Miss Madoline Thomas) gave valuable weight to the ending. She brought out, as Miss Diana Rigg as Adriana continues to do, both the reality of the character and the aspect of farce that it is compelled by the situation to present. But on the whole there is too little of the first element in this year’s revival.</quote></p>

<p>1964<space extent="1em"/>20 May. Lincoln Center, New York. Julie Christie (Luciana), Elizabeth Spriggs (Courtezan), Michael Williams (Pinch). <title level="j">New York Times</title> (21 May, p. 43): <quote part="I">The only aim of the British troupe [of the 1962 and 1963 productions] is to distill laughter from the innocent japes of this green work of Shakespeare’s, and&hellip;there is an abundance of boisterous, farcical spirits.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">For a brief time they go through the paces of the silly plot with its mixed identities as if they believed every word of the cheerfully turned, self-important couplets. But presently Clifford Williams’s staging starts to caper and to make a merry mockery of the mounting, idiotic confusions. Elegance of style shades into rowdy slapstick and boisterous horseplay.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">[Yet e]ven when they descend to wild, swift sight gags, they remember that the cream of the jest is best savored if the story is not utterly curdled.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Thus when Ian Richardson as Antipholus of Ephesus must explain everything at the end to a just, though bewildered Duke, he does so with the exasperation of a man outrageously aggrieved. He is all the funnier for being in earnest.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Alec McCowen as Antipholus of Syracuse accepts the favors of the striking Diana Rigg as Adriana, the other Antipholus’s wife, with the dubious air of a man who knows that in the real world such generosities rarely are thrust upon a stranger.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Julie Christie as Adriana’s lovely sister is pained when</quote> she is made love to. <quote part="I">Yet she cannot quite suppress the sigh of pleasure that such ardor must bring to a vulnerable heart.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">During the first half of the play, though the characters and actions are childish, the spirit is not hopelessly remote from plausibility.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">In the second half, however, Mr. Williams lets himself go. When Antipholus of Ephesus and his Dromio are to be sent to gaol&hellip;they are roped together, and fall, like a single log, into the waiting hands of four gaolers.&hellip;Michael Williams as Pinch the conjuror speaks with a sibilance that ends in a blast like a steam whistle’s, and he resorts to a crescendo of ludicrous spells and incantations.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">When Miss Rigg cries, she goes boo-hoo. Not a frantic boo-hoo, you understand, but an unmistakable wail all the same. The kind to make you chuckle and laugh, which is the sole business of this lark by the young Shakespeare.</quote></p>

<p>1975<space extent="1em"/>8 Aug. Delacourt, Central Park, New York. John Pasquin’s production for Joseph Papp. Ted Danson played a bodyguard, Danny DiVito was Balthazar, Linda Lavin the Courtesan. Sometimes the critics detest what audiences love. Mel Gussow (<title level="j">New York Times</title>, 17 Aug., p. 97): <quote>The fat maid teetering on a terrace of Santo Loquasto’s cuckoo-clock of a revolving set feverishly twirls a large round piece of fabric over her head until it completely envelops her. Is this meant to be a pizza the size of a tablecloth or a tablecloth shaped like a pizza?&hellip;The sight gag gets an easy laugh—that time and <hi rend="italic">every</hi> time it is re-introduced.&hellip;This is a low-comedy, broken-Italian version.&hellip;Eggplants and zucchini are thrown like hand grenades. Steaming hot barber towels are dropped down the front of men’s trousers. Barn-size bloomers are exhibited like battle trophies. The Duke of Ephesus is a broad-bellied Mafioso in a white suit and pencil moustache and his bodyguard is a pistol-toting gangster (the production must set some sort of New York Shakespeare Festival record for gunfire). The carabiniere looks like Mussolini (this <quote>Comedy</quote> takes place in the thirties <quote>in a small Italian village</quote>). The dialogue is heavily spiced not just with <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">scuse</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">che cosa?</foreign> but with <quote>dissa</quote> and <quote>datta.</quote> And how many jokes can you make about flatulence?&hellip;But on the night I attended the audience seemed to love it.</quote></p>

<p>1976<space extent="1em"/>21 Sept. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Roger Rees (S. Antipholus), Mike Gwilym (E. Antipholus), Judi Dench (Adriana), Brian Coburn (Duke Solinus), Michael Williams (S. Dromio), Nickolas Grace (E. Dromio), Richard Griffiths (Officer), Robin Ellis (Pinch), Francesca Annis (Luciana). Guy Woolfenden, music. Trevor Nunn, lyrics (derived from lines in the play) and director. Irving Wardle (<title level="j">Times</title> [London], 30 Sept., pp. 12–13): <quote part="I">Trevor Nunn moves from the balletic economy of Clifford Williams’s version to the opposite extreme of lavish ornamentation, not to mention reworking the piece as a musical.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Ephesus, as staged by John Napier and Dermot Hayes, is a fun-city bursting with novelty shops and tourist traps, swarming with gloved mobsters and amiable thigh-flashing tarts, and under the thumb of a hulking ducal dictator&hellip;who first waddles on under a load of military fruit salad to deliver his judgment on Aegeon over the public address system.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">All this represents no particular time or place, but it is certainly the domain of comedy; and comedy of a kind that expands naturally into music. As with the RSC’s previous excursions into popular music, Guy Woolfenden’s score knows its place. It does not give you much to hum on the way out, but it supplies an admirable springboard into dramatic song and dance. The lyrics, mainly built from turning points in the plot, have the effect of further translating the story into fairy tale.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The sentence on Aegeon is worked up into a chorus number that turns his predicament into a game. Likewise, Antipholus’s proposition to the indignant Luciana (a spinsterly bespectacled Francesca Annis) changes into a playful duet.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">By such means the whole show ascends into comic fantasy. Antipholus, locked out of his house, conducts an enraged debate over the intercom which he finally pulls away from the wall. The culminating hue and cry starts during a western and takes place to the sound of gunshot and thundering hooves. Also, there are delicious added details such as Richard Griffiths’s officer, a glum stooge dragged around after his captive and making a dejected ceremonial appearance in Greek army tutu and long combinations.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">We are unlikely ever to see a funnier Adriana than Judi Dench, a peremptory odalisque downing her terrified servants with flying trays and point-blank bursts from the soda syphon and relapsing into voluptuous submission with her supposed husband.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The two Antipholuses get finally [sic: finely?] contrasted and physically close casting from Roger Rees (wearing his camera even into the bedroom) and Mike Gwilym, a sharp gum-chewing resident who fits precisely the Las Vegas-like setting. Michael Williams and Nickolas Grace dispatch two carrot-haired, baggy-jeaned Dromios with balletic clowning. And Robin Ellis’s Dr Pinch goes off nicely in a puff of smoke.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_scom1982"><name type="app">Scott</name></ref> (1982, pp. 14–16) approvingly analyzes some of the interpolated songs, drawing on the prompt copy in the Shakespeare Centre Library at Stratford-upon-Avon. E.g., (p. 15): <quote>Adriana taking refuge in Campari and soda, and the bespectacled Luciana attractively peering around her book at the play’s action, were given a lengthy, amusing duet and dance routine concerning <quote>A man is master of his liberty.</quote></quote></p>

<p>The setting, presumably a Greek resort town, was uncertain enough to make one reviewer (Ned Chaillet, <title level="j">Times</title> [London] 15 Nov., p. 17) call it <quote>an Italian village square bedecked with trinkets and tourist goods</quote> and another, reviewing the previous year’s Stratford-upon-Avon production: <quote>A contemporary Turkish market</quote> where garments hang from the balconies, the Porpentine and the Tiger are bars, and <quote>Aegeon [is] clearly in the rag trade</quote> (Roger Warren, <title level="j">ShS</title> 30 [1977], p. 176).</p>

<p>Nunn’s production seems to have been the first in which Adriana takes S. Antipholus to bed, raising pretty serious problems about how he and Luciana are to behave thereafter. Reviewers, however, hardly even mention the seduction, and none reports how the aftermath was handled. In the 1980 San Diego National Shakespeare Festival production, Adriana started out as a dowdy housewife opposite a sexy, knowing Luciana who instructed her how to improve her appearance. She did so, and entered Act 5 visibly pregnant, fainting when she saw that there were two Antipholuses. See n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_0607-01">607–14</ref>.</p>

<p>1983<space extent="1em"/>12 Feb. Goodman Theater, Chicago. Mel Gussow (<title level="j">New York Times</title>, 13 Feb., pp. 56–7): <quote part="I">As virtuosi of the New Vaudeville, the Flying Karamazov Brothers—a team of unrelated young American zanies—juggle everything from tenpins to telephones, from pussycats to pepperoni pizza.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The evening begins with Avner Eisenberg&hellip;a sad-faced clown and not a Karamazov. He sweeps the stage and lifts a trapdoor to dispose of the litter. Then the trapdoor reopens and out pops an agitated William Shakespeare (Timothy Daniel Furst, the si&shy;[<hi rend="italic">57</hi>]lent Karamazov): One might say that Shakespeare has just been trashed.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The other Karamazovs play the twins&hellip;and it is difficult to tell one Antipholus from the other. Howard Jay Patterson and Paul Magid are both long-whiskered Cossacks quick with a retort. Their Dromios (Samuel Ross Williams and Randy Nelson) look different but their comedy is equally demented. More than his partners, Mr. Nelson has a linguistic ability that is within the reach of Shakespeare.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">They toss the plot up in the air as if it were a dish and then keep it spinning there. Jokes wander as far afield as Broadway (<title level="m" rend="quotes">West Side Story</title>) and Chicago politics (Mayor Jane Byrne). However, whenever possible, the company takes its cue for comedy from Shakespeare. A Dromio reference to football&hellip;is followed by a huddle, a game of touch and a cheer for old Notre Dame.</quote></p>

<p>1983<space extent="1em"/>9 Aug. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Henry Goodman and Richard O’Callaghan (Dromios), Zoe Wanamaker (Adriana), Paul Greenwood and Peter McEnery (Antipholuses). Adrian Noble directed. Ultz designed the costumes and makeup. All the actors had colored faces, usually white, but blue for the Antipholuses. The Dromios were in clown suits (baggy pants, oversize shoes, and big noses). The pit band marked every pratfall, collision, fart, and kiss with appropriate sounds. Luciana’s blond hair looked like an inverted ice cream cone. James Fenton (<title level="j">Sunday Times</title> [London], 14 Aug., p. 35) admires Noble’s <quote>making the actors speak the verse pantomime style, with a blatant emphasis on simple rhythms and rhymes. This is some of the best verse-speaking we have had at Stratford in recent years.</quote> Anthony Masters (<title level="j">Times</title> [London], 10 Aug., p. 11) regrets the unrelieved farce: <quote>The one element in the play which will never be there is the very real drama surrounding Adriana’s marriage with the Ephesian Antipholus, which is cracking up badly when his Syracusan twin brother blunders in. Husband’s back from lunch late and reluctantly after long business drinks, wife’s sister refusing marriage because she sees it in practice: there is plenty here a director could have used.</quote></p>

<p>1990<space extent="1em"/>25 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Desmond Barrit (Antipholuses), Graham Turner (Dromios), Estelle Kohler (Adriana), Caroline Loncq (Luciana), David Waller (Aegeon), David Killick (Pinch). Stanley Wells (<title level="j">Times Literary Supp.</title>, 4–19 May, p. 474): <quote part="I">Ian Judge’s production&hellip;is firmly grounded in David Waller’s serious delivery of the grief-stricken Aegeon’s opening narration, its comic potential acknowledged only as, warming to his task, he obligingly draws a diagram [of the arrangement of the family on the mast] to explain to the increasingly sympathetic Duke how he and his family succeeded in surviving shipwreck. This is affecting and true, but as soon as it is over we are thrust into a world of farcical stereotypes and mechanistic stylization which, accurately though it may reflect the dexterity of Shakespeare’s plotting, drains the play’s characters of even the limited reality with which Shakespeare has infused them. The Merchant becomes two nearly identical, strutting, bowler-hatted business men, one in green, the other in purple, carrying briefcases and umbrellas—these figure largely in the production—and sharing the character’s lines, sometimes speaking them in unison. Balthasar is a conventionally funny huntin’-and-shootin’ old buffer, Luciana a bespectacled frump first seen reading a copy of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, in violent contrast to Estelle Kohler’s wearisomely outrageous Adriana, prancing around in billowing veils and relentlessly burlesquing every line with exaggerated gestures, simpering leers, and camp intonation.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">This production style puts a premium upon cleverness. It takes its tone from the decision to have each pair of twins played almost throughout by a single actor. Their casting is unconventional. Antipholus (Desmond Barrit) is a fat, sleek-haired Latin type, actorishly skilful at milking lines for comic effect, more convincing in his flirtations with the audience than in his wooing of Luciana. Dromio&hellip;is usually thought of as a robust contrast to his more gentlemanly master, but Graham Turner, a natural mime with expressive features, is a slight figure, sweet-natured in his efforts to entertain and with a delicate touch of pathos in his put-upon resilience.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">The most original aspect of the production lies in its evocation of the Surrealist movement in, for example, the reproduction of Salvador Dalí’s couch modelled on Mae West’s lips on which Adriana and Luciana rise from below the stage on their first entry, and also in the symbolic devices hanging over the stage in Mark Thompson’s attractive, door-lined set. This is acceptable because there is something surrealistic in the confusions of this play, especially in its hints at supernatural forces at work in Ephesus. Less happy is the director’s use of traditions of popular entertainment. There is delicacy in the initial reminiscences of René Clair, Ibert and Chaplin, but before long we are in the world of <hi rend="italic">Carry On</hi> films and television magic shows.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Two especial traps for self-indulgent directors&hellip;are the Courtesan and Dr Pinch. Mr Judge falls into both. His Courtesan is a leering, hobble-skirted madam, drawing easy laughs as, tottering on high heels, she flails around with a besequinned handbag; and the Dr Pinch episode is drawn out interminably with Pinch as a tasteless caricature of Dali himself in the role of a conjurer (in the standard misinterpretation of Shakespeare’s use of the word) who causes Antipholus to disappear and Dromio to be sawn in half.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The production reaches a climax of self-destructive vulgarity with the descent of a madonna surrounded by flashing neon lights to indicate the Priory from which the Abbess and her attendants emerge in parodic costumes. If at this late stage in the proceedings something Shakespearean emerges it is, first, because Cherry Morris as the Abbess, triumphing over her ludicrous get-up, gives a sense of emotional reality to her reunion with her long-lost husband, and second because, in the play’s delightful coda, with two Dromios at last on stage together, Shakespeare’s point that we depend for our sense of identity on the reactions of others is realized in the embarrassed joy with which Graham Turner’s Dromio finds not only his brother but himself.</quote></p>

<p>This production, which the critics hated, was extremely popular, and was taken on tour after its London performances.</p>

<p>In addition to the actors mentioned in the preceding lists, the following have played S. Antipholus, seemingly as the more sympathetic role: Baliol Holloway, Old Vic, 1927; David Birney, Delacourt, New York, 1967; John Wood (to Corin Redgrave’s E. Antipholus), RSC, 1972. Other Dromios include Charles Durning (E. Dromio), Delacourt, New York, 1967; Michael Flanders (S. Dromio), 1963 (audio disc <title level="m">Living Shakespeare</title> SCE 45–46).</p>

<p>Productions of <title level="m">Err.</title> outside England and North America have appeared chiefly in the West. The first German production seems to have been an adaptation, one of four Shn. adaptations, played in Heidelberg in 1679 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stae1947"><name type="app">Stahl</name></ref>, 1947, p. 30). <title level="m">Err.</title> was played infrequently in the 18th and 19th c., but in the 20th c. performances increase. Hans Rothe’s version (1921), which strips the play of the romance plot, emphasizes Luce and gives her a low-comic cook Emmelina, was popular well into the late 20th c.; sometimes the romance plot is restored (Stahl, pp. 620–1; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goob1991"><name type="app">Gooch</name>, <name type="app">Thatcher</name>, et al.</ref> 1991, e.g., 1:210, #2185, 12 Dec. 1982).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_milp1997"><name type="app">Milward</name></ref> (1997) mentions Japanese productions from 1951 to 1987. One, in 1980, in the words of its producer Tetsuo Anzai (p. 491), <quote>relied upon the style of the Commedia dell’Arte. We built a sham, play-within-a-play stage roofed with a tent upon the real stage of the hall; and all the action was done on this counterfeit stage&hellip;to induce a more willing suspension of disbelief by making the audience aware that everything is a play, so that we could pursue the intensity of the action to a greater extremity than possible otherwise.</quote> In Norio Deguchi’s production of 1987 the actors wore masks until the dénouement when all the errors were resolved (p. 493).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goob1991"><name type="app">Gooch</name>, <name type="app">Thatcher</name>, et al.</ref> (1991) list performances using incidental music in Santiago, Johannesburg, Limoges, Perth, Turin, Verona, Milan, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Aarhus, and several in Poland, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia clustered in the five years after World War Two, as well as later.</p>

<p>No film of <title level="m">Err.</title> has been made. In addition to <title level="m">The Boys from Syracuse</title> and the Julian Slade BBC musical version noted above, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rotk1990"><name type="app">Rothwell</name> &amp; <name type="app">Melzer</name></ref> (1990, pp. 41–5) list and comment on several television productions including the Kraft Television Theatre, 7 Dec. 1949; the Clifford Williams production on 1 Jan. 1964, using the Stratford-upon-Avon cast filmed at the Aldwych Theatre, London (simulcast in the United States); the Trevor Nunn production, 1976, discussed above; and the Flying Karamazov Brothers’ 1983 production, filmed at Lincoln Center after moving to New York from Chicago.</p>

<p>The most available of the television productions is a BBC version from 1984. Director: James Cellan-Jones, Cyril Cusack (Aegeon), Susanne Bertish (Adriana), Roger Daltrey (both Dromios), Charles Gray (Solinus), Wendy Hiller (Aemilia), and Joanne Pearce (Luciana). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rotk1990"><name type="app">Rothwell</name> &amp; <name type="app">Melzer</name></ref> (1990, p. 44): <quote>A main feature is the <quote>doubling</quote> of the principal characters, the Antipholuses and the Dromios, the latter being portrayed by rock star, Roger Daltrey.&hellip;The <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell arte</foreign> style allows integration of mimes and street-players into the plot and <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">mise en scène</foreign>. Equally attention-getting is the huge map of the eastern Mediterranean that makes up the market floor and the marvellous lighting that gives the illusion of a sun-drenched Mediterranean seaport town.</quote></p>

<p>Locating the play, with some interest either in showing an <quote>Ephesus</quote> or, as is now more common, in devising a setting far removed from a historical locale, depends on the physical resources and aesthetics of the time. <title level="m">Err.</title> requires no interior locations; it does require doors to be knocked on and entered and exited from. But over time conventional spaces have developed. With the establishment of movable scenery following the Restoration, the painted flats and drops follow the same pattern until the rise of elaborate fixed sets in the 1870s. Prompt-books and playbooks describe the scenery, even stipulating into which grooves the flats were to be placed. The play now requires a throne room, a street in the mart, a chamber in E. Antipholus’s house, and the exterior of the priory. For Hull’s version, there has to be a garden, and, under the influence of Reynolds’s staging, a chamber in the priory for the revised conclusion. Costumes apparently made little attempt to give a Near Eastern atmosphere. <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_dang1827"><name type="app">Daniel</name></ref> (ed. 1827) lists what is needed: <quote>DUKE.—Rich shape with long flowing arm-hole robe of blue velvet, white pantaloons, white shoes, hat and feathers&hellip;TWO ANTIPHOLISES.—Light blue shapes trimmed with yellow buttons, blue stockings, russet boots, cross belts, swords, hat and feathers&hellip;ADRIANA. Rich embroidered satin dress, with flowing crimson satin robe, jewels, &amp;c.</quote></p>

<p>By the end of the 19th c. elaborate scenery becomes popular. Photographs of the Crane and Robson production of 1885 noted above show decorative excess. The Duke, in oriental finery, sits on a raised throne with a canopy, guarded by soldiers in Roman armor (helmets, shields, chain armor). This opening scene features huge Corinthian columns and a view of Ephesus through a large bow window. The Abbess wears a Greek Orthodox–style habit. The Courtesan (Phryne) is borne in on a sedan chair carried by four bare-chested black youths. For Act 5, there are palm trees in the foreground, and Ephesus harbor in the background (<title level="m">The Illustrated American</title>, 14 Oct. 1893).</p>

<p>In recent times, beginning with Komisarjevsky’s famous Stratford-upon-Avon production (1938), the settings have taken on surprising qualities. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_leis1986"><name type="app">Leiter</name></ref> (1986, p. 69): <quote>Hudd [Old Vic, 1957] and Treyz chose the environment of Elizabethan playhouses; Robin Phillips (1975) [Stratford, Ont.] found fun in the Canadian West of Conestoga wagons&hellip;; John Ezell (Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, 1980) used a classical Mediterranean town; Arthur Storch employed seventeenth-century Florence; Gillette A. Elvgren, Jr. (Pittsburgh, 1981), evoked <quote>Turko-Hollywood-Roman</quote>&hellip;and Robert Woodruff [1983] went for a theatrical world suggestive of the circus. Aiming at an Ephesus where the strangest things could happen, Nagle Jackson in 1970 [Oregon Sh. Festival, Ashland] created a town with a flamboyant assortment of colorful, often bizarre, theatrical images. Modern dress also has been tried, as in John Bell’s Australian production of 1978, set in <quote>the clearly cosmopolitan city of Ephesus.</quote>&hellip;Trevor Nunn created a loosely defined modern setting that suggested anywhere from Turkey to Las Vegas. The 1920s were the background for Bill Cain’s 1980 Boston Shakespeare Company version: <quote>strobe lights, barbershop quartets, and costumes made of long-johns</quote>&hellip;tickled many funny bones. That same year Paul Barry’s New Jersey staging found the Mardi Gras in a 1920s New Orleans a congenial setting; a wild assortment of costumes was thus justified. Ben Levit’s 1978 Dallas production&hellip;successfully placed the play in a 1930s Neapolitan world.&hellip;In such modern dress productions the Duke was likely to be a garish dictator and the Syracusans foolish tourists.</quote></p>

<p><title level="m">Err.</title> has invited two staging opportunities that stand out, the doubling of one or both sets of twins by a single actor, and the perhaps surprising introduction of <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell’arte</foreign> when the play makes no clear call for such staging.</p>

<p>The first instance I can find of one actor’s playing both twins comes in 1899, when Ben Greet plays the Dromios (see above). In the 1923 production by the Ethiopian Art Theatre (also above), the <title level="j">New York Times</title> (20 May 1923) praises Charles Olden for doubling the Dromios. Both sets of brothers were doubled in Stratford, Conn. (1963); in Stratford, Ont., in 1989, in a double bill with <title level="m">Tit.</title>; in the BBC television production (1984) with Michael Kitchen as Antipholus and Roger Daltrey as Dromio (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wils1991"><name type="app">Willis</name></ref>, 1991, a detailed performance diary); and in the 1990 RSC production at Stratford-upon-Avon (above). The doubling requires that some speeches be cut or that they be combined. Sometimes a mute twin appears, playing with his back to the audience. In the television version, split-scene capabilities let the twins talk to each other.</p>

<p>The problems that arise in doubling are addressed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_slar1991"><name type="app">Slawson</name></ref> (1991, pp. 67–8): <quote>While casting one actor as both Dromios or both Antipholuses may solve the problem of their appearance, it creates new problems for the director. Chief among these is blocking the final scene, in which both sets of twins appear onstage simultaneously. The most common solution&hellip;is to use a <quote>mute</quote> double for one of the twins and to cut or reassign the lines of that twin. However, unless skillfully done, [<hi rend="italic">68</hi>] cutting parts of the final scene lessens the comic effect of the whole production.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_holp1997"><name type="app">Holland</name></ref> (1997, pp. 58–9) elaborates on the use of a single actor for both twins: <quote>Since the idea cannot possibly work in the theatre [as it can on television], I shall be wondering what is lost in the process.&hellip;One of the great [<hi rend="italic">59</hi>] pleasures for the audience watching <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> is that we know the answer. We know, because Egeon has told us, that there are two pairs of twins; we know why Antipholus of Syracuse is recognized by the citizens of Ephesus and that the reason has nothing to do with Ephesus’ reputation for sorcery nor is it a dream. But we also find that the overweening confidence with which we begin, knowing the answers, is shaken in the course of the play. Every time I watch the play, I end up forgetting which Dromio has been sent on which errand by which Antipholus.&hellip;We are nearly as confused as the characters. When both Dromios are played by the same actor the audience’s ability to be confused, a confusion that the play wants us to undergo, is simply evaded, evaded because the audience comes to follow actor, not role, Graham Turner not Dromio.</quote></p>

<p>It has become usual to stage <title level="m">Err.</title> with <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell’arte</foreign> aspects, started on the English stage by Komisarjevsky in 1938. The first mention of such staging that I have found occurred at Strasbourg in 1935 in a performance by a traveling German company; the Dromios wore <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia</foreign> costumes (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kosa1935"><name type="app">Koszul</name></ref>, 1935, p. 184). How much earlier that company had adopted the costumes I do not know. The next I have found is Douglas Seale’s Birmingham Repertory Theatre production in 1948 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_trej1963"><name type="app">Trewin</name></ref>, 1963, p. 146). Clifford Williams’s 1962 RSC production featured an unobtrusive harlequinade as audience for Egeon’s tale, and thereafter as needed. Coincidentally, the 1963 Stratford, Ont., and Stratford, Conn., productions continued the trend.</p>

<p>The Ontario production was directed by Jean Gascon to very bad reviews, not limited to the <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia</foreign> aspects. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_edia1963"><name type="app">Edinborough</name></ref> (1963, p. 433): <quote>He chose to ignore the text of <title level="m">The Comedy of Errors</title> and make it a Punchinello pantomime affair&hellip;[with] five Punchinellos acting as general theatrical factotums around the stage.</quote> All the actors save the women wore <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia</foreign> masks.</p>

<p>The Connecticut production was directed by Douglas Seale, who presumably repeated his Birmingham production. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ogdd1963"><name type="app">Ogden</name></ref> (1963, p. 438) on Seale’s production: <quote>Apparently in order to alleviate the long opening recital, the director introduced a troupe of <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia dell’arte</foreign> players. As Aegeon related his past history, the half-masked actors filed on, seated themselves facing the audience along the front edge of the apron, and occasionally one or the other mimed a bit of what was being said stage center. But as the evening progressed one began to wonder just what these figures had to do with the play. Upstage center they erected portions of a trestle stage, moved from pose to pose, watched the action, and at one point two members of the company interrupted the drama with a dance. But never did the troupe become part of the performance.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rogg1964"><name type="app">Rogoff</name></ref> (1964, p. 168) wonders why <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia</foreign> should be used at all, referring to the coincidence of the employment of it in the two preceding productions, and says: <quote>As a directorial exercise, [<title level="m">Err.</title>] asks only for a jubilant return to what might be called basic theatre&hellip;[to] primitive mummeries, lampoons, and Dionysiac celebrations.&hellip;There may be little inherently wrong in choosing <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">commedia</foreign> for production background, but it is, at least, less right than the available choice of earlier models, the Roman perhaps more than the Greek.&hellip;Why leave the roots behind?</quote></p>

<p>In addition to productions of Shakespeare’s play, a few adaptations are known about or guessed about, because only a few saw print.</p>

<p>1716<space extent="1em"/>10, 12, 13 Mar. Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Adapted in three acts as <title level="m">Every Body Mistaken</title> by William Taverner and Dr. Brown. Not published. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thel1960"><name type="app">Avery</name></ref> (<title level="m">London Stage</title>, 1960, 2.1:392): Main Piece <quote>Never Acted Before,</quote> that is, not since the reopening of the theaters in 1660.</p>

<p>1734<space extent="1em"/>9, 11, 14 Oct., 2 Nov. Covent Garden. Adapted as <title level="m">See If You Like It, or, ’Tis All a Mistake</title>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thel1960"><name type="app">Scouten</name></ref> (<title level="m">London Stage</title>, 1961, 2.2:393): <quote>Afterpiece: A New Comedy in Two Acts, intermixed with Songs, taken from Plautus and Shakespear. &lt;Author unknown. Apparently not printed. <title level="j">Daily Journal</title> lists Raleigh-Hall.&gt;</quote></p>

<p>1780? 1790<space extent="1em"/>Theatre-Royal, Edinburgh. <title level="m">The Twins, or, Which is Which</title>. This is a three-act farce by William Woods. It begins with 1.2, inserting much of Egeon’s opening speech into the mouth of S. Antipholus. It inserts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1310" targetEnd="#tln_1320">1310–20</ref> at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0258">258</ref>. Act 1 ends at the end of <title level="m">Err.</title> 3.1. Act 2 begins with a recapitulation of S. Antipholus’s adventures in Ephesus and continues at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0861">861</ref>, the description of Nell. The act ends at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1424">1424</ref>. Act 3 begins at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1462">1462</ref>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_woow1783"><name type="app">Woods</name></ref> (1783, p. 1) says that frequent repetitions of events in the play, and the <quote>mistakes,</quote> perplexed the audiences, which seems to indicate at least occasional performances in Edinburgh. He goes on, <quote>With a view to remedy these defects, the editor, a few years ago, reduced the comedy to three acts, and it was performed as an after-piece, with much approbation; but as his veneration for the author made him retain too many of the scenes, there still existed&hellip;too much confusion and uniformity of the original. He has therefore ventured to make further alterations.</quote> There is no record of its being played outside of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>1780<space extent="1em"/>York? John Philip Kemble’s adaptation <title level="m">Oh! it’s impossible!</title> The Dromios were played as black servants <quote>to puzzle the house as well as the stage</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_boaj1825"><name type="app">Boaden</name></ref>, 1825, 1:33). It was never published, and Boaden thinks that had it been, Kemble would have burned the whole impression on <quote>maturer judgment.</quote></p>

<p>ca. 1858<space extent="1em"/>New York. <title level="m">Ye Comedie Of Errours. A Glorious, Uproarous Burlesque. Not Indecorous nor Censorus, With Many A Chorus, Warranted Not To Bore Us, Now For The First Time Set Before Us</title>. This is a blackface minstrel version, written by John F. Poole <quote>expressly for Charley White,</quote> a well-known minstrel born in 1821, who moved to England in 1859. It is <quote>a quite workable, small-scale transference of some of Shakespeare’s episodes to a New York negro setting</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wels1978"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>, 1978, p. x). The main characters are named Andy Foolus and Dummy-O.</p>

<p>Operas and musical versions based on <title level="m">Err.</title> are as few as the adaptations.</p>

<p>1786<space extent="1em"/>12 Dec. Vienna. Stephen Storace, Mozart’s friend and likely student, wrote <title level="m">Gli Equivoci</title>, with <quote>an excellent libretto by Da Ponte [who] changed most of the names</quote>: the Antipholuses becoming Euphemio, Adriana becoming Sofronio, sung by Storace’s sister Nancy; he invents a wife and little son, Dromioncino, for S. <quote>Euphemio</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fisr1986"><name type="app">Fiske</name></ref>, 1986, pp. 495–6). It appears to have been successful.</p>

<p>1819<space extent="1em"/>11 Dec. Covent Garden, London. Frederick Reynolds’s operatic version, music (an overture and song settings) chosen by Henry Bishop, including Thomas Arne and Mozart (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goob1991"><name type="app">Gooch</name>, <name type="app">Thatcher</name>, et. al.</ref>, 1991, 1:194). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_genj1832"><name type="app">Genest</name></ref> (1832, 9:46–7): <quote>Shakspeare’s play was on this evening turned into an Opera—this literary murder was committed by Reynolds—he did not put his name to the play when printed, but in his Life he acknowledges the fact.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">47</hi>] Reynolds, when the important business of a song is not concerned, does not differ much from Kemble’s text [1811, i.e., Hull].&hellip;He has added some other short speeches, which do him but little credit.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hunl1949"><name type="app">Hunt</name></ref> (1949, pp. 327–90), reviewing this version on 26 Dec. 1819, is disgusted by the complete lack of resemblance in the twins (<quote>persons no more resembling each other than moisture and drought</quote>), but otherwise finds the production attractive, granted that it has little to do with <title level="m">Err.</title> It was acted 27 times.</p>

<p><quote>Act 1 scene 2—Luciana enters sola for the sake of singing a song—at the close of the act, a new scene is added for the sake of a sonnet and a glee—Antipholus of Ephesus enters with Balthazar, and wishes him <hi rend="italic">good night</hi>—the improvers of Shakspeare rarely fail to fall into absurdities.</quote> Reynolds says in his introduction to his version that since <title level="m">Err.</title> is such a short play, it <quote>has been selected as the best vehicle for</quote> the introduction of songs from other plays <quote>which use, however, has required additional scenes and passages&hellip;absolutely necessary for this purpose.</quote> The songs, some of them slightly adapted, include the Willow song; <quote>Under the greenwood tree</quote>; Edgar’s <quote>Swithold footed thrice the ’old</quote>; <quote>Bacchus, monarch of the vine</quote>; <quote>It was a lover and his lass</quote>; <quote>Blow, blow, thou winter wind</quote>; <quote>Tell me, where is fancy bred?</quote>; <quote>What shall he have that kill’d the deer</quote>; stanzas from <title level="m">Ven.</title>; and several poems from <title level="m">The Passionate Pilgrim</title>, including <quote>Come live with me and be my love.</quote></p>

<p>But there is more: some of the stage business found in the later prompt-books begins with Reynolds; his is examined below.</p>

<p>1923<space extent="1em"/>7 May. Frazee Theatre, New York. Ethiopian Art Theatre, a Chicago-based <quote>Negro</quote> company formed by Raymond O’Neil in the 1920s. <title level="j">New York Times</title> (20 May, X): <quote>The action takes place on a rude platform in a circus tent and absurd scenes are shifted by clowns under the crack of the ringmaster’s whip. A jazz band plays, not only for the scene shifters but for Dromio himself when he is most furiously clowning.</quote> The Dromios were played by Charles Olden.</p>

<p>1938<space extent="1em"/>23 Nov. Alvin Theatre, New York. <title level="m">The Boys from Syracuse</title>. Music by Richard Rogers; lyrics by Lorenz Hart; book by George Abbott, who also directed the show. Ronnie Graham was E. Antipholus, Eddie Albert was his brother, Jimmy Savo was S. Dromio, and Teddy Hart his brother. The production staff comprised Jo Mielziner (scenery and lighting), George Balanchine (choreographry), and Irene Scharaff (costumes). <title level="a">Falling in Love with Love,</title> <title level="a">This Can’t Be Love,</title> and <title level="a">Sing for Your Supper</title> became popular standards. It was made into a film in 1940 with Joe Penner playing both Dromios, Martha Raye as Luce, Eric Blore as Pinch, and Eddie Acuff as a taxi-driver (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rotk1990"><name type="app">Rothwell</name> &amp; <name type="app">Melzer</name></ref>, 1990, p. 42).</p>

<p>1950<space extent="1em"/>8 June. Cambridge, England, Amateur Dramatic Club. <title level="j">Times</title> ([London] 9 June, p. 4e): John Barton produced a musical burlesque that, while it had little resemblance to <title level="m">Err.</title>, caused great pleasure.</p>

<p>1954<space extent="1em"/>16 May. BBC TV. An operetta, music by Julian Slade, libretto by Lionel Harris, with Joan Plowright as Adriana (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goob1991"><name type="app">Gooch</name>, <name type="app">Thatcher</name>, et al.</ref>, 1991, 1:215).

<div type="level2" xml:id="div_textonstage">
<head>The Text on the Stage</head>

<p>I have examined the following prompt-books and printed texts based on performances at specific theaters and dates. The prompt-books contain, on interleaved pages or blank spaces in the text, descriptions of the scenery, props, costumes, and stage business; I have excerpted a few of these to give some flavor of productions. But much of my discussion deals with the changes made in Sh.’s language. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_halw1979"><name type="app">Halstead</name></ref> (1979, vol. 2) collates most of the following prompt-books, and several more, but his collations are sometimes incorrect or misleading. For the theatrical texts I give the Folger Library identification number, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shac1965"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>’s (1965) identification number, or a library call number.</p>

<p>The treatment of the text, from Smock Alley in the 1670s through most of the 19th c., is a history of cutting what is already a very short play. At 1,920 lines it is the shortest in the canon (line counts before the standardizing of TLNs use 1,735, 1,787, or some such as the number of lines). Songs were added as early as the Nursery arrangement; in the 18th c. the play was either the main piece or an after-piece in an evening of two plays, and indeed it has been paired with <title level="m">Tit.</title> in the 20th c. The earliest cuts often involve ten or more consecutive lines, totaling 400–500 lines per version. All these cuts take out pretty much the same material: most of Egeon’s and the Abbess’s roles, Adriana and Luciana’s debate on wifely subordination, badinage between master and servant involving obscure or indecent puns, speeches expressing Adriana’s jealousy, S. Antipholus’s highly decorated wooing of Luciana, indecent or blasphemous material involving the Courtesan, and speeches in Act 5 that recapitulate the action.</p>

<p>The data detailed below are drawn from the following versions of the play:</p>

<list xml:id="list_app_004">

<item><p>3.<space extent="1em"/>Tonson: The Comedy of Errors. By Mr. William Shakespear. London: Printed for J. Tonson, and the rest of the Proprietors&hellip;1734.</p>

<p>This is a reprint of <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pope2"><name type="app">Pope</name></ref> (ed. 1728), to protest a pirated ed. of several of Sh.’s plays by R. Walker <quote>and his Accomplices&hellip;[who], to screen their innumerable Errors, advertize, that they are printed as they are acted; and industriously report, that the said Plays are printed from Copies made use of at the Theatres,</quote> as William Chetwood, prompter at Drury Lane, says in his introduction, declaring that no one has ever had a prompt copy from him. Pope <quote>degraded</quote> passages he thought unworthy of Sh. to the bottom of the pages, but he also marked passages he particularly liked in quotation marks (ed. 1725, 1:xxii f.). (These lines are misunderstood as cuts in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_halw1979"><name type="app">Halstead</name></ref>’s analysis.) This probably is what Macklin played in 1741, before Thomas Hull’s version replaced Pope’s.</p></item>


<item><p>4.<space extent="1em"/>Bell’s Sh.: The Comedy of Errors, by Shakespeare. An Introduction, and Notes Critical and Illustrative, are added by the Authors of the Dramatic Censor [Francis Gentleman]. London: Printed for John Bell&hellip;1774.</p>

<p>This ed. seems to be based on <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cap"><name type="app">Capell</name></ref> (ed. 1768). Gentleman puts in quotation marks passages, usually accompanied by justifying footnotes, that he recommends cutting, though he lets them stand in the text rather than degrading them.</p></item>


<item><p>5.<space extent="1em"/>Hull: The Comedy of Errors with Alterations from Shakspeare. Adapted for Theatrical Representation by Thomas Hull. As Performed at the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden. A New Edition.&hellip;London. Printed by John Bell, British Library, Strand&hellip;1793. (Cornmarket Press Facsimile, 1971.)</p>

<p>As noted above, the longtime actor at Covent Garden, Thomas Hull, began modifying <title level="m">Err.</title> as early as 1762; he published his version in 1770, and again in 1793, the one examined here. His adaptations held the stage for over fifty years. In the cast list he names the Courtesan Lesbia (<quote>Lesbias</quote> is a misprint in the Dramatis Personae); Luce becomes Bridget in 3.1, but is not named in the DP.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_halw1979"><name type="app">Halstead</name></ref> does not recognize the importance of this adaptation, and thus credits Inchbald or Kemble with variants found initially here; hence, Halstead’s analysis is very misleading in this respect.</p></item>

Printed under the Authority of the Managers from the Prompt Book. With Remarks by Mrs. Inchbald. London&hellip;[1808]. (The British Theatre, vol. 1.)</p>

<p>This is Hull’s adaptation, very slightly adjusted. While it is common to refer to this ed. as Mrs. Inchbald’s, she presumably had no hand in the text. John Philip Kemble had taken over as manager at Covent Garden in 1802; his company played <title level="m">Err.</title> on 9 Jan. 1808. Kemble customarily prepared new prompt-books for his revivals; Covent Garden burned down on 20 Sept. 1808, destroying the contents of the building including the library (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_boaj1825"><name type="app">Boaden</name></ref>, 1825, 2:452–8).</p></item>


<item><p>7.<space extent="1em"/>Kemble: Shakspeare’s Comedy of Errors, Adapted to the Stage by Thomas Hull; Revised by J. P. Kemble, and Now First Published as it is Acted at The Theatre Royal in Covent Garden. London: Printed for the Theatre. 1811. [Folger PR 2804|1811|Sh Col.; <title level="m">John Philip Kemble Promptbooks</title>. Vol. 1. 1974.]</p>

<p>A prompt-book, lightly annotated in Kemble’s hand, of Hull’s adaptation, with a few verbal changes, directions for actors’ movements, blocking for ensemble scenes, and some stage business. Kemble names the first and second Merchants Cleon and Chares. His <quote>Persons Represented</quote> consist of <quote><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen—Attendants on Doctor Pinch—Executioner—Sisters of the Convent</hi>.</quote> He does not print the words for Hermia’s song in 3.2 (see below), and gives the messenger’s speech, 1641–50, to Bridget, thus perhaps saving himself the cost of a small speaking part.</p>

<p>This is the text of the first revival following the 1808 fire. The title page makes it clear that Kemble sold his acting versions at his theater. Since Inchbald and Kemble follow Hull so closely, they will be mentioned only when they differ from Hull. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shac1974"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref> (1974, 1:xviii ff.) contains a concise description of staging methods that use grooves, cuts, and drops.</p></item>

At <quote>To <hi rend="italic">Epidamium</hi>,</quote> a hand adds something like <quote>where some time | wee liv’d,</quote> and at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0053">53</ref> rewrites: <quote>There had we [not <hi rend="italic">she</hi>] not been long,</quote> before the birth of the twins.</p>

<p>Balthazar is deleted from the SD to 3.1, and a single line surviving from his part, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0640">640</ref>, is spoken instead by Angelo. Even that line is cut by Hull. Oddly, Balthazar reappears in Inchbald’s Dramatis Personae (Mr. Atkins), presumably because Hull retained (his spelling) <quote>You’re sad, Signor Balthasar</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0638">638</ref>); the character is silent, and yet the custom of casting him continued, beginning with Cumberland (1827).</p>

<p>Cuts from 1.1: <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0012" targetEnd="#tln_0013">12–13</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0035" targetEnd="#tln_0039">35–9</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0045">45b</ref>–<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0052">52</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0067" targetEnd="#tln_0080">67–80</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0090" targetEnd="#tln_0097">90–7a</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0101" targetEnd="#tln_0105">101–5</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0107" targetEnd="#tln_0111">107–11</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0118" targetEnd="#tln_0123">118–23</ref>, ?<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0149" targetEnd="#tln_0151">149–51</ref> (unclear whether a cut is intended), <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0153">153a</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0154">154b</ref>, most to shorten Egeon’s long speech. From 1.2: <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0245">245</ref>, possibly as no longer idiomatic; and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0264" targetEnd="#tln_0271">264–71</ref>, possibly as redundant.</p>

<p>These cuts number about 538 lines and half-lines. They inevitably anticipate most of what later producers would cut, chiefly by shortening long speeches, getting rid of the unintelligible (either garbled lines or references that no longer made sense), and deleting offensive sexual or religious language. It is interesting that, as a reflection of changes in taste, Sh.’s images are sometimes apparently thought to be too ingenious.</p>

<p>There is also some minor rewriting, e.g., <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0106">106</ref> <hi rend="italic">At last</hi> <quote>[o]ur helpefull</quote>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0521">521</ref> <quote>gulfe</quote> for <hi rend="italic">sea</hi>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0542">542</ref> <quote>dame</quote> for <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0620">620</ref> <quote>shrewish</quote> for <hi rend="italic">peevish</hi>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0612">612</ref> <quote>Carkanet</quote> for <hi rend="italic">golden chain</hi>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0795">795</ref> <hi rend="italic">but</hi> <quote>[l]et</quote>; <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1218">1218</ref> <hi rend="italic">I sent thee to the bay roge to see if</hi> <quote>any ships</quote>; and the senseless switching of S. and E. Dromio in the last two speech prefixes.</p>

<p>Hull’s 1793 version, adopted by Kemble, influenced performances of <title level="m">Err.</title> until Phelps restored much of the original text and cut Hull’s additions, though many of Hull’s cuts were retained. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chih1935"><name type="app">Child</name></ref> (1935, p. 8) summarizes the nature of Hull’s changes when he writes about Kemble’s theatrical practices: <quote>His <title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title> at Covent Garden in 1808 was nothing but the version made for that theatre nearly thirty years before [i.e., Hull’s]&hellip;—a version which takes infinite pains to remove every trace of rhyme; turns the chain into a bracelet; mixes up Balthazar and Aegeon [sic for Angelo]; squeezes pathos or <quote>sentiment</quote> into the Antipholis (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)-Adriana-Luciana plot, writes up Dromio of Syracuse into a fat part (Gentleman Lewis had been great in it, and Munden followed him), and gives to Antipholis of Syracuse one immortal line of blank verse: <quote>In spite of my assertion to the contrary</quote>—where Shakespeare had written: <quote>For urging it the second time to me.</quote></quote></p>

<p>Hull rewrites the rhymed speeches into blank verse at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0286" targetEnd="#tln_0317">286–317</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0577" targetEnd="#tln_0581">577–81</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0787" targetEnd="#tln_0860">787–860</ref>, and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1104" targetEnd="#tln_1134">1104–34</ref>; the rewriting involves cuts as well. The quality of Hull’s rewriting may be seen in Luciana’s speech on female subordination (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0289" targetEnd="#tln_0299">289–99</ref>):

<quote rend="block">Why, headstrong liberty belongs to a man,
<lb/>And ill befits a woman’s gentle mind.
<lb/>There’s nothing situate under Heaven’s eye,
<lb/>But hath it’s [sic] bound on earth, in sea, and air;
<lb/>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged tribes,
<lb/>Are their males subjects, and at their controul.
<lb/>Man, more divine, the master of them all
<lb/>Indued with intellectual sense and soul,
<lb/>Is master to his female—nay her lord!
<lb/>Let then your will attend on his commands.</quote></p>

<p>Hull retains some of the Smock Alley cuts—how could he not?—but he also initiates many other changes. In 1.1, he avoids the problem of how the boys came to have the same name (<quote>And, which was strange, the one so like the other, | As could not be distinguish’d but by names,</quote> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0055" targetEnd="#tln_0056">55–6</ref>) this way:

<quote rend="block"><space extent="6em"/>our wealth increas’d
<lb/>By prosp’rous traffic—’till my factor’s death,
<lb/>Drew us unwillingly to Epidamnum.
<lb/>There had we not been long, but she became
<lb/>A joyful mother of two goodly sons,
<lb/>And, strange to hear, the one so like the other,
<lb/>They hardly by ourselves could be distinguished.</quote>

He rewrites the opening speech, adding after TLN <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0005">5</ref> <quote>And terminate, by this, thy rig’rous doom, | Ægeon’s life and miseries together.</quote> After <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0064">64</ref>, the Duke interrupts Ægeon’s account with <quote>Stop thy tears—| I long, yet almost dread to hear the rest,</quote> to break up the long speech, which he, like most producers, cuts by close to half. At the end of the scene, Ægeon’s exit speech becomes

<quote rend="block">What friends can misery expect?
<lb/>This pity but prolongs the date of pain:
<lb/>And to a sure, though short protracted end,
<lb/>Helpless and hopeless doth Ægeon wend,</quote>

which shows that Hull will write rhymes, though why he reverses Sh.’s <quote>Hopelesse and helpelesse</quote> is a mystery.</p>

<p>In 1.2 following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0180">180</ref> <quote>meane,</quote> Dromio wonders why Antipholis trusts him with so much money, and Antipholis replies that he believes that Dromio loves him too much to rob him; the dialogue amounts to 16 lines, serving to cement the loyalty of master and servant. The rest of the scene goes by largely unscathed until S. Antipholis’s final speech, which is replaced after <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0262">262</ref> by lines beginning <quote>Misguided by my hopes, in doubt I stray, | To seek what I perchance, may never find</quote>; the note of a frightening Ephesus is replaced by sentimentality.</p>

<p>Except for rewriting the rhymed dialogue on marital obedience and cutting <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0354" targetEnd="#tln_0357">354–7</ref>, perhaps to get rid of the puns in 2.1, Hull allows the scene to stand, though he rewrites the garbled passage <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0382" targetEnd="#tln_0389">382–9</ref>:

<quote rend="block">Sister, you know he promis’d me a bracelet—
<lb/>Some stranger fair hath caught his truant eye,
<lb/>And triumphs in the gifts design’d for me.
<lb/>Such trifles yet with ease I could forego,
<lb/>So I were sure he left his heart at home!
<lb/>I see the jewel best enameled
<lb/>Will lose its lustre—so doth Adriana—
<lb/>Whom once, unwearied with continual gazing,
<lb/>He fondly call’d the treasure of his life!</quote></p>

<p>In 2.2 much of the punning between servant and master on sconces and Time (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0429" targetEnd="#tln_0502">429–502</ref>) is cut by Hull (and by most others, beginning with Smock Alley); the scene resumes at Adriana and Luciana’s entrance (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0504">504</ref>). For the rhymed couplets of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0577" targetEnd="#tln_0581">577–81</ref>, he substitutes <quote>What, was I married to her in my sleep; | Or sleep I now, and dream I hear all this? | What error thus deceives our eyes and ears? | Yet, that the mystery I may explore, | I’ll seem to entertain the fallacy.</quote> He then cuts S. Dromio’s <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0583" targetEnd="#tln_0587">583–7</ref>, on being caught in fairy land; rearranges some lines; cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0607" targetEnd="#tln_0615">607–15</ref>; and substitutes 16 lines, beginning

<quote rend="block">Spread for dinner. I am afraid I shall
<lb/>Be somewhat awkward, as I am not
<lb/>Acquainted with the ways of the house,
<lb/>Tho’ I suppose they’ll be so courteous
<lb/>As to instruct a new-comer.—Ay, there they go—
<lb/>The house with the green doors,</quote>

which answers a question—whoever asked it?—about how the stranger managed to guard the door so well; it also tells us a bit about the scenery. The prompt-books specify a <quote>practical,</quote> i.e., workable, lockable door outfitted with a bell; this was built into the flat usually called the <quote>Street house,</quote> located in the second groove.</p>

<p>He makes several changes in 3.1. He cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0630" targetEnd="#tln_0637">630–7</ref>, adding <quote>Silence, thou sot, or I shall sober thee!</quote> before <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0638">638</ref>, and then cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0641" targetEnd="#tln_0650">641–50</ref>, as does Smock Alley. At <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0651">651</ref>, <quote>But soft, my doore is lockt,</quote> he adds, <quote>Sirrah, ring the bell,</quote> allowing E. Dromio to say <quote>Oh, he’s a little soberer, and he does know his own house now,</quote> before an accompanying <hi rend="italic">Rings</hi>. He then inserts before <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0652">652</ref>:

<quote rend="block"><sp><speaker>An. of Eph.</speaker><p>Will they not hear?</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Dr. of Eph.</speaker><p>In good truth, I think they will not.—My mistress, sure, means to be quits with you, master—you denied her a while ago, and now she’s determined to deny you.</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>An. of Eph.</speaker><p>Have done, thou varlet. Call to them, bid them let us in.</p></sp></quote>

He cuts <quote>Either get thee from the dore, or sit downe at the hatch</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0655">655</ref>), presumably because his stage door was solid. Following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0712">712</ref>, he cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0713" targetEnd="#tln_0744">713–44</ref>, as does Smock Alley in large part, and substitutes:

<quote rend="block"><sp><speaker>An. of Eph.</speaker><p>Get from the gate?—What means this saucy language?
<lb/>There’s something more in this!—Why, Adriana!</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Ad.</speaker><p>[<stage type="description">Within</stage>.] Hence, you familiar coxcomb! Cease your noise,
<lb/>Or you shall surely pay for all this outrage.—
<lb/>Dromio, make sure you keep fast the doors against ’em.</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>An. of Eph.</speaker><p>Why, wife, I say.—</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Dr. of Syr.</speaker><p>[<stage type="description">Within</stage>.] She’s gone back to dinner, sir, to take a refreshing cup, and has no time to answer idle questions now.</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>An. of Eph.</speaker><p>Now, on my soul, some strange mysterious guile,

<lb/>Some shameful minion is here entertain’d—

<lb/>While they are revelling to my dishonour?
<lb/>Go, fetch an instrument—I’ll break the door,
<lb/>Shatter it to pieces, but I’ll enter.</p></sp></quote>

At the end of the scene, he cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0781" targetEnd="#tln_0782">781–2</ref> and adds after <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0783">783</ref> for E. Antipholis:

<quote rend="block">I thank you, sir.—And now, my dainty wife,
<lb/>Checking my rage, I’ll leave you to your follies
<lb/>Some few short hours; enjoy them while you may,
<lb/>Perchance to-morrow you may rue your jest.</quote></p>

<p>His largest addition comes at the beginning of 3.2, where he brings onstage in a <quote><hi rend="italic">A Garden</hi></quote> S. Antipholis, Adriana, Luciana, and <quote>Hermia,</quote> whose sole function is to sing Michael Arne’s setting of Hull’s <quote>Stray not to those distant plains,</quote> a pastoral wish that the beloved <quote>tarry here with me and love.</quote> This addition with its song presumably goes back to the 1762 <hi rend="italic">Twins</hi> (above), since Arne died in 1784; for the 1779 revival, Charles Dibdin’s setting was used (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goob1991"><name type="app">Gooch</name>, <name type="app">Thatcher</name>, et al.</ref>, 1991, 1:197). The song is preceded by Adriana’s asking S. Antipholis why he is so distant, and he replies <quote>I would some friendly light | Might chase away the mist that clouds our fancies, | And give this dream a meaning!</quote> He goes on to describe the garden, <quote>These beauteous bowers, in nature’s fragrance rich,</quote> the whole addition apparently concocted to employ pastoral scenery and the song. Sometimes the addition was cut. Fawcett, in the J. S. Clarke prompt-book: <quote>When wanting to play the piece quickly this scene is cut to the entrance of Ant of S&hellip;beginning with <quote>Why how now Dromio [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0862">862</ref>],</quote></quote> a drastic cut that deletes the wooing of Luciana.</p>

<p>After the song, Adriana continues, using lines adapted and repeated from <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0505" targetEnd="#tln_0541">505–41</ref> in 2.2 until she and Hermia exit and 3.2 begins as in Sh. Hull’s repetition of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0525" targetEnd="#tln_0541">525–41</ref> in 2.2 and 3.2 is puzzling; the lines disappear from 2.2 as early as Inchbald (1808); the lines had been cut by Smock Alley.</p>

<p>Hull now adds 3.3, the meeting between S. Antipholis and Angelo (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0956" targetEnd="#tln_0972">956–72</ref>), which cannot take place in the garden but rather requires a change of scenery. At the end of his 3.2 Hull, having cut Dromio’s geography of Nell (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0889" targetEnd="#tln_0927">889–927</ref>), has Antipholis exit and lets Dromio conclude the scene with <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0944" targetEnd="#tln_0945">944–5</ref>, <quote>As from a bear a man would run for life, | So I from her that swears she is my wife,</quote> and exit. His new scene begins with the entrance of Angelo greeting S. Antipholis (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0956">956</ref>). The scene is required because the garden scenery (located in the sixth or last groove, noted in the prompt-books) has to be replaced by <quote>The Street</quote> scenery (located in the first or second grooves) so that the two can speak. This new scene requires that Antipholis exit and return immediately after Dromio’s lines, unless Hull’s Act 1 ends at Dromio’s exit. This latter appears to be what happens. Kemble (1811) adds in his hand to the new entrance of Angelo and Antipholis <quote>and Dromio of Syracuse,</quote> plus the line <quote><hi rend="italic">Ant. of Syr.</hi> Haste to the port, and find me out some ship,</quote> before Angelo’s greeting (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0956">956</ref>). Kemble is elaborating the beginning of Sh.’s Act 2. The scene ends with Antipholis’s rewritten soliloquy praising Luciana, which concludes with <quote>Unwillingly I go—my wounded soul, | (Howe’er from Ephesus my body part) | Lingers behind in Luciana’s heart.</quote></p>

<p>Despite the preservation of F’s five-act division in print, Hull’s 1793 version perhaps, and later performances certainly, were presented in three acts. The Folger Library has a playbill for the 31 May 1791 performance, a benefit for Hull: <quote>After which [i.e. <title level="m">The Midnight Lover</title>] will be performed (in Three Acts) The COMEDY of ERRORS.</quote></p>

<p>The 19th-c. prompt-books make it clear that the curtain drops at Dromio’s exit at 3.2 (the <quote>bear</quote> line), and again at the end of 4.4. As we will see, Reynolds’s prompt-book describes a pantomime between S. Dromio and Luce that marks the end of his Act 1. Act 2 (in a three-act version) begins with Dromio entering, repeating those two lines about running from a bear, and being sent off to the port. Act 2 ends at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1461">1461</ref>, with a good deal of horseplay, recorded in the prompt-books, involving struggles between Pinch and the Syracusans, who enter at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1440">1440</ref>. In fact, Cumberland’s SD is <quote><hi rend="italic">Dr. Pinch runs across from</hi> R. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> L. <hi rend="italic">after them</hi>.</quote> This business continues well after Phelps had returned to the authentic play, as prompt-books 12, 13, and 14 testify.</p>

<p>Hull’s Act 2 follows Sh.’s Act 4 closely. At the end of Sh’s 4.1 he expands Dromio’s speech about returning to Adriana’s to get the purse of ducats; Dromio worries that <quote>Blowzabell,</quote> the renamed Dowsabell, may appear and <quote>fright me from my purpose.</quote> In Sh.’s 4.2, after <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1128">1128</ref> Hull gives Luciana an expanded speech urging Adriana’s patience while expressing admiration for S. Antipholis’s <quote>person</quote> as a prelude to her accepting him at the end of the play. In 4.3, the meeting of the Courtesan/Lesbia with the Syracusan twins is greatly rewritten. Lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1231" targetEnd="#tln_1263">1231–63</ref> are replaced with S. Antipholis’s scolding her for her looseness:

<quote rend="block">What more temptations?
<lb/>Mistress, you do impeach your modesty,
<lb/>Here in the street to commit yourself
<lb/>Into the hands of one who knows you not.</quote>

The Placides give us stage business to accompany her entrance: <quote>Fondling around his neck.</quote> As the Syracusans move to leave her, she follows, and Dromio turns on her: <quote>No, you don’t. [<hi rend="italic">Draws.</hi>] Here’s my charm against witches,</quote> followed by <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1237" targetEnd="#tln_1240">1237–40</ref>. The Placides, Clarke, and Crane &amp; Robson record a variant piece of business involving a horseshoe, the charm against witches and evil in general: <quote>Lesbia turns to Dromio. he faces her, pulls out a Horseshoe, and Xes in front to R. H.</quote> Hull follows Sh.’s 4.4 almost exactly, but he changes Adriana’s <quote>Oh binde him, binde him</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1396">1396</ref>) to <quote>O! hold him, hold him,</quote> which signals a change in business. Reynolds’s prompt-book below shows how the scene was played.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0023">Hull says in his preface that he provides a more satisfactory <quote>catastrophe</quote> than Sh.’s. Following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1831">1831</ref> Ægeon, Æmilia, and S. Antipholis supply the feeling that Hull finds missing, beginning <quote><hi rend="italic">Ægeon</hi>. Æmilia! O! support thyself, my soul! | Till I, once more, have caught thee within my arms, | Their long, lost happiness!</quote> Antipholis’s speech includes <quote>O raise my father, raise your reverend hands | And bless your truant son!</quote> Ægeon asks where his lost son is, Æmilia speaks <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1841" targetEnd="#tln_1847">1841–7</ref>, then E. Antipholis comes forward with an affecting greeting of his parents, and the brothers embrace. Following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1863">1863</ref>, Hull amplifies the future of Luciana, as S. Antipholis continues:

<quote rend="block"><sp><p>And that the heart which beats alone for you,
<lb/>May, now the mist of error is dispers’d,
<lb/>Which made thee fearful for thy virgin fame,
<lb/>Obtain a gentle hearing.</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Luc.</speaker><p>Should I find thee
<lb/>Worthy, and constant, as my mind suggests,
<lb/>The general joy, that smiles around, shall not
<lb/>Be damp’d by any vain reserve of mine.</p></sp></quote>

Following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1897">1897</ref>, the Duke continues:

<quote rend="block"><sp><p>And be a cheerful witness of the blessings,
<lb/>Your pious faith, and virtuous resignation,
<lb/>Have drawn upon you from relenting Heaven!</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Ægeon.</speaker><p>Come, and partake
<lb/>The joys, that gild the evening of our days.</p></sp>
<lb/><sp><speaker>Æmilia.</speaker><p>Joys past the reach of hope!—our lesson this,
<lb/>That misery past endears our present bliss;
<lb/>Wherein we read with wonder and delight,
<lb/>This sacred truth, <quote>Whatever is, is right.</quote></p></sp></quote></p>

<p>So ends the play. Strikingly, Hull omits the happy recognition of the Dromios that ends the play proper.</p>

<p>His 1793 text is 1,544 lines long.</p>

<p>Inchbald’s 1808 version copies Hull; the differences may be no more than mistakes. For example, <quote>thy natiue home</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0033">33</ref>) becomes <quote>my native home,</quote> and is immediately corrected in 1811. The First and Second Merchants have not yet been given names.</p>

<p>Kemble’s 1811 prompt-book has a few handwritten directions for cuts and wording, as well as directions for actors’ movements. As we have seen, Kemble adjusts Hull’s 3.3, the meeting of S. Antipholis and Angelo, to bring on S. Dromio. He cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1540" targetEnd="#tln_1545">1540–5</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1614" targetEnd="#tln_1616">1614–16</ref>, and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1618" targetEnd="#tln_1619">1618–19</ref> (as do most playbooks after 1811, which are willing to shorten the Abbess’s role even more; Smock Alley anticipates many of these cuts). The first Merchant is now Cleon, the second is Chares, as they will continue to be named.</p>

<p>Reynolds’s 1819 musical version involves some rewriting that describes stage business that comes to be recorded in the 19th-c. prompt-books.</p>

<p>At the end of Sh’s 2.2, Reynolds modifies Hull’s lines (gone is the reference to the green door). Dromio is haled from within <quote>Dromio, Dromio,</quote> and he responds, <quote>Oh! a lady in waiting—Dear sweet unknown! thy doating Dromio comes.</quote> The Placides milk this business a bit: after <quote>lady in waiting,</quote> they add, <quote>Oh, Oh! its my turn now, and if love making be the only mischief going forward, the servant may take place of the master,</quote> concluding as Hull does. This business prepares for the pantomime at the end of Sh.’s 3.2 (Reynolds’s Act 1).</p>

<p>In 3.1, when E. Antipholis has decided to break down his door, he says to Dromio <quote>Go. (To Dromio, stamping and menacing). <hi rend="italic">Dromio</hi>. Gone!</quote> This addition becomes common.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0008">Reynolds replaces Hull’s 3.3 with S. Antipholis entering alone to praise Luciana, followed by S. Dromio’s lines from Sh.’s 3.2 saying that he is afraid the kitchen wench will turn him into a curtal dog made to <quote>turn i’ the wheel</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0935" targetEnd="#tln_0936">935–6</ref>); Reynolds adds <quote>I fly with joy, for now I shall be blown safe, | From this same scullion—this mountain of mad flesh</quote> (moved from <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1457">1457</ref>), then <quote>As he is going off, the fat Kitchen Wench suddenly throws up the window in Antipholis’s house, and shakes her fist at him. <hi rend="italic">Kitchen W.</hi> Come back, or I’ll so baste thee Dromio. <hi rend="italic">Dr. of Syr.</hi> ’Tis she.</quote> Notice that the flat containing the workable door now requires a workable window. The Placides add more to the pantomime: the Cook (their Kitchen Wench) leans out of the window to shake a ladle (a prop suggested by the <quote>basting</quote> language in <title level="m">Err.</title>) at him, leaves the window, enters to Dromio, and <quote>She catches Dromio. He throws her down—and runs off. L[eft]. She pursues him, through 1st &amp; 2 entrances. Dromio hides behind 1. E[ntrance]. R[ight]. H[and].—Cook falls over his foot—Dromio hastily pulls her dress over her feet and runs off. Cook rises limping. Ring quick,</quote> ending their Act 1. This business appears irresistible to the actors. J. S. Clarke adds <quote>Music. Enter the cook, made up very large, but neat—sees Drom. of S. she chases him round as she x’s he trips her up up [sic] &amp; while down he exits L. 1. E she being large takes time to rise &amp; as she rises (Enter Dromio of Ephesus R.1.E.&hellip;they see each other—ad lib comic bus. Dro. in Cooks embrace: Ring!</quote> These calls for a quick curtain complete the evolution of a 3-act structure going back to Hull.</p>

<p>Reynolds provides more business for S. Dromio in 4.2, after he bursts in to get the purse E. Antipholis needs to pay Angelo. At <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1158">1158</ref>, <quote>this I wonder at,</quote> Adriana <quote>(turning to Dromio, who is fanning himself) Why how now? Thou art faint! <hi rend="italic">Dr.</hi> To be sure I am. <hi rend="italic">Adr.</hi> Go—refresh thyself—(Dromio smiles and bows.) Haste—repair thee to the kitchen. <hi rend="italic">Dro.</hi> The kitchen! O Lord!—don’t mention it—I’m quite well, ma’am—quite!</quote> The 19th-c. prompt-books examined below write this material in.</p>

<p>In 4.4, Reynolds follows Sh.-Hull to <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1405">1405</ref>, Pinch’s cry to <quote>Go bind this man, for he is frantic too,</quote> meaning E. Dromio. But Reynolds elaborates the action. <quote><hi rend="italic">Dr. of Eph.</hi> (Rubbing his hands with joy.) Good seize the gaoler! the shoulder slapper. <hi rend="italic">Pinch</hi>. And him! (Pointing to Dromio.) Seize on that varlet—they are all possess’d, | And must be bound and laid in some dark room. <hi rend="italic">Dro. of Eph.</hi> I! I bound in a dark room. <hi rend="italic">Off.</hi> (To Doctor’s servants.) Stand off—.</quote> Only the Placides retain the business.</p>

<p>Reynolds restores some of the Dromios’ reunion at the end of the play. They are allowed to say <quote>I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.&hellip;And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before the other</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1910" targetEnd="#tln_1918">1910–18</ref>), followed by their exit into the Abbey, for which Reynolds writes a final scene that preserves most of Hull’s sentimental conclusion. This restoration leads to greatly enhanced business for the Dromios. The most elaborate prompt-book description is the Placides’. <quote>The two Dromios at extreme corners Look at each other and turn away laughing—Approach each other C. and stepping in the same manner. When near each other, both burst out laughing and run back to proceniums [i.e., the proscenium doors]. Both advance again to centre. They put up L. foot and laugh—they put up R. foot in same manner. Dromio of E. looks at himself from head to foot, Turns his brother round to look at him, and then giggles to himself—same business with Dromio of S.</quote> The dialogue ensues, then <quote>They place hands on each other’s shoulders, and go up as the others advance. The two Dromios change smiles at back, and come down extreme corners.</quote> Even this business evolves; J. S. Clarke gives part of it: at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1909">1909</ref> <quote>[Dromios] who have been asleep R &amp; L Now gradually awake—yawn—both X to C &amp; up not seeing each other &amp; at the [proscenium] door as they are about to enter, see each other—start—, come down C—look at each other—the[y] embrace &amp; look together.</quote> Finally, the whole business becomes clear in the Crane &amp; Robson prompt-book, 1878: at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1775" targetEnd="#tln_1776">1775–6</ref> <quote>during this Dromio of Ephesus has gone to sleep L[eft]. H[and proscenium door],</quote> so <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1783" targetEnd="#tln_1787">1783–7</ref> is cut. At <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1832">1832</ref> <quote>During this Dromio of Syracuse enters quickly and unperceived and goes to sleep opposite the Dromio of E. R. H.</quote></p>

<p>Henry and Thomas Placide adopt many of the standard cuts noticed already; the following are either unique to the Placides or are the first. The most startling cut, considering that the passage has drawn the most academic comment, is that of S. Antipholis’s water-drop speech (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0199" targetEnd="#tln_0204">199–204</ref>). Since the Placides played the Dromios, they may have thought that there was no need to make Antipholis needlessly interesting; they also take away his <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1187" targetEnd="#tln_1194">1187–94</ref>. They cut the redundancy of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0255">255</ref>, which repeats <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0254">254</ref>. Nearly like Smock Alley, they cut E. Antipholis’s plan to dine with the Courtesan (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0768">768b</ref>–<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0075">75a</ref>), a cut followed by almost no one else. Cutting Pinch’s diagnosis of E. Antipholis as being possessed and needing to be tied up in a dark room (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1380" targetEnd="#tln_1382">1380–2</ref>) may reflect current medical practice. They are the only ones to cut all of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1406" targetEnd="#tln_1439">1406–39</ref>—others cut bits and pieces—a passage that requires a lot of the cast to be onstage in very busy action at the end of Act 4. The Abbess’s refusal to turn <quote>E.</quote> Antipholis over to Adriana until she has cured him (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1572" targetEnd="#tln_1576">1572–6</ref>; Smock Alley cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1575" targetEnd="#tln_1581">1575–81</ref>) may have seemed too detailed, though it is part of the other cuts having to do with illness, or perhaps it is just in the tradition of reducing the Abbess’s importance. The Placides are alone in cutting Ægeon’s misery at not being recognized by the Ephesian twins (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1774" targetEnd="#tln_1788">1774–88a</ref>). One wonders whether the lines are expendably long, susceptible of misplaced laughter rather than pity, or what. Cyril Cusack, in the 1984 BBC TV production, wore no beard, so <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1792" targetEnd="#tln_1793">1792–3</ref> was cut.</p>

<p>Samuel Phelps’s restoration (1855) has already been mentioned. He cuts only about 234 lines, considerably fewer than anyone before him. Many are the usual cuts, bowdlerizations, removal of unintelligible puns, and the like. For example he cuts, from Egeon’s opening speech, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0037" targetEnd="#tln_0039">37–9</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0046" targetEnd="#tln_0052">46–52</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0072" targetEnd="#tln_0078">72–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0087">87</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0091" targetEnd="#tln_0093">91–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0096">96</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0103" targetEnd="#tln_0105">103–5</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0107" targetEnd="#tln_0109">107–9</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0116" targetEnd="#tln_0117">116–17</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0120" targetEnd="#tln_0123">120–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0139">139</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0149" targetEnd="#tln_0152">149–52</ref>, and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0158" targetEnd="#tln_0159">158–9</ref>, many anticipated by Smock Alley or Hull and followed by most others. He restores the garbled <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0385" targetEnd="#tln_0389">385–9</ref>. Surprisingly, some of Hull’s additions remain: the Duke’s interruption after <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0064">64</ref>, <quote>Stop thy tears—| I long, yet almost dread, to hear the rest,</quote> seems irresistible; Dromio’s lines added by Hull at the end of 2.2 (following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0607">607</ref>) are penciled in following <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0615">615</ref>—these are the important additions. His cuts include the punning on Time (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0458" targetEnd="#tln_0502">458–502</ref>); E. Antipholis’s recapitulation (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1698" targetEnd="#tln_1730">1698–1730</ref>); and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1910" targetEnd="#tln_1915">1910–15</ref>, reducing the Dromios’ reunion by half. The Merchants are Kemble’s Cleon and Chares, but Lesbia gives way to Courtezan. Phelps also adopts the act and scene divisions of F. Hence, the familiar statement that the Phelps production restored Sh.’s original text is only partly accurate.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0037">The Clarke prompt-book (3 Oct. 1864) is valuable in describing the marketplace setting of 4.3, as S. Antipholis remarks on how he has been familiarly approached. The prompt-book begins: <quote>Music. Scene 3. The Mart. A lively scene. Stalls R. &amp; L. on the extreme L. C. a tailors stall, with goods—and a large basket with cover to shut; goods hung over. As scene opens—Citizen Xx recross—stop at stalls—during which Enter Ant of Syracuse, some recognize him,—1 A woman meets him &amp; bows—2 A man gives him a scroll—3 a page gives him a letter—after this bus the music ceases and Ant of S speaks.</quote> The basket comes into play at the end of Act 2 (<title level="m">Err.</title> 4.4, TLN <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1460">1460</ref>) with business of a scuffle involving Pinch and both sets of twins, first the Syracusans who escape, then the Ephesians.

<p>George Ellis’s prompt-book (for the 27 Feb. 1864 performance) markings are somewhat unlike the preceding ones because of his frequent canceling or replacing of just a word or two in a line, as well as adding more frequent notes on how to emphasize readings, e.g., <quote>Gaze where you <hi rend="italic">should</hi>, and that will <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> your sight</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0844" targetEnd="#tln_0845">844–5</ref>). Examples of his minor changes are <quote>troubles</quote> for <hi rend="italic">travels</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0142">142</ref>), <quote>failing</quote> for <hi rend="italic">falling</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0201">201</ref> in the water-drop speech), <quote>males subject</quote> for <hi rend="italic">males subjects</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0293">293</ref>), <quote>woman</quote> for <hi rend="italic">strumpet</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1416">1416</ref>), and <quote>strangers</quote> for <hi rend="italic">harlots</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1682">1682</ref>). He follows several bowdlerizations of his predecessors: <quote>and she would&hellip;Sir-reverence</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0876" targetEnd="#tln_0882">876–82</ref>), <quote>diviner</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0929">929</ref>), <quote>privy</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0930">930</ref>), as well as the expected replacements for <quote>God.</quote></p>

<p>He has fuller notes of business than his predecessors as well, especially when others than the Dromios are concerned. In 2.2, when Adriana and Luciana approach the Syracusans, Adriana <quote>takes his hand</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0505">505</ref>), <quote>embraces him</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0507">507</ref>), and at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0515">515</ref>, Antipholus is <quote>bewilder’d during this,—suddenly withdraws from Adr,—Dromio greatly excited, also.</quote> At <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0560" targetEnd="#tln_0561">560–1</ref>, <quote>How can she thus then call us by our names | Unless it be by inspiration,</quote> <quote>Dro goes up L—in bewilderment,—looks about, at every thing &amp; every body &amp; goes over to R,—stands gaping with wonder—his back to the audience.</quote></p>

<p>It is interesting that in the same year (1864) that Clarke’s American prompt-book records the marketplace setting at the beginning of 4.3, Ellis has a new scene, his scene 7, that begins at Angelo’s entrance in 3.2 (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0955">955</ref>); this new scene is the one examined as Hull’s 3.3 above. Ellis’s setting is <quote>Exterior of the House of Antipholus of Ephesus | 2 Gro[ove]</quote>; the scene opens with Dromio’s <quote>As from a bear a man would run for life, | So fly I from her that would be my wife</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0944" targetEnd="#tln_0945">944–5</ref>), then <quote>Enter Antipholus of Syracuse from the House. X’s stage—is going off R-1C—as Merch<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> &amp; friend enter L-1C—friend X’es &amp; Exit R-2C—as Merch<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> calls Ant—.</quote> His next scene, Sh.’s 4.1., is the Mart, with a sketch showing two bales; directions call for two merchants and two porters, <quote>Merch<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> seated on a bale, writing mems &amp; notes—which he gives to both porters, and sends them off R &amp; L.</quote> These extras have additional business as far as <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1040">1040</ref>.</p>

<p>Ellis’s production was in Feb. 1864, Clarke’s in Oct., but Ellis’s prompt-book was not prepared until 1882. Just when the staging of the busy marketplace began I cannot say.</p>

<p>Komisarjevsky’s 1938 prompt-book gives a fascinating description of that landmark production, famous for its set with a manic clock that chimes hours unconnected with the chronology of the play. In the center of the stage is the abbey, with the clock, flanked on stage left by the Phoenix, Pinch’s house, the Tiger Inn, a pawn shop (the <quote>usurer’s,</quote> designated the <quote>4th Merchant</quote> in SPs), Balthazar’s house, and the Porcupine, and on the right by the Centaur, a tailor’s house, an unmarked door, a fish stall (<quote>5th Merchant</quote>), and Angelo’s house. The Phoenix and the Porcupine have windows, used prominently. Ranged before the houses are three squat blocks used as seats. Sh.’s cast has been fleshed out with a tailor, innkeeper, three policemen, two sailors, two ladies, and the extra merchants. Luce is always called Nell. These extras groan, sigh, and murmur during the long speeches in the first and final acts. They are also given portions of the long speeches (e.g., <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1588" targetEnd="#tln_1597">1588–97</ref> are divided among the fourth Merchant, Balthazar, Angelo, Courtesan, the fifth Merchant, the tailor, and the first Merchant). Another feature of this production is the silent presence of Pinch and the Courtesan throughout the play; Nell appears at the Phoenix’s window or at the door, once amorously embracing E. Dromio.</p>

<p>Komisarjevsky rearranges one section of the play to conclude his first act: after S. Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana and her exit to get Adriana’s <quote>goodwill</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0860">860</ref>), Angelo enters with the chain, offering it to the wrong brother (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0955" targetEnd="#tln_0979">955–79</ref>). After the exit, Komisarjevsky inserts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1103" targetEnd="#tln_1134">1103–34</ref> from 4.2, Adriana’s mortified response to Luciana’s report, played from the window of her house, followed by Dromio’s description of Nell, which brings down the curtain.</p>

<p>The clock strikes seven times in the play, ringing 12 o’clock at the end of 1.1; 1 o’clock and 2 o’clock at the end of 1.2, with the notice to <quote>Turn hands of clock quickly</quote>; 3 o’clock at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0615">615</ref>, and 4 o’clock at the interval curtain. But the next time it rings, it sounds 9 o’clock at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1161">1161</ref>, presumably to account for the interval, then twice more, the last (10 o’clock) at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1598">1598</ref>. The dialogue is adjusted either by cutting references to the passage of time (e.g., <quote>halfe an houre since</quote>—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1051">1051</ref>) or by rewriting (<quote>nine,</quote> <quote>eight</quote> for <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, <hi rend="italic">one</hi>—<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1166">1166</ref>).</p>

<p>Very little of the play is cut, but some speeches are reassigned, as we have seen. Perhaps the most interesting rearrangement occurs at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0290" targetEnd="#tln_0299">290–9</ref>, part of Luciana’s speech on female subordination; these lines, which sound bookish, are spoken by Pinch, who enters reading a book and is perhaps quoting from it.</p>

<p>The 1962 Clifford Williams prompt-book contains by far the most detailed descriptions of movement of all these prompt-books. Pages of the unidentified printed play are pasted on workbook pages measuring 8″ x 10″ so as to put between 30 and 45 lines on a page, on average. Opposite these pages are the directions, sometimes as many as 30 to a page, which typically read (1.2): <quote part="I">Enter U|S P|S Antipholus of Syracuse with 1st Merchant (to Ant’s P|S). X to C ros[trum] 1. Dromio of Syracuse follows X behind Ant to O|P C ros 1 to 8.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">1. 1 Mer gives Ant. money bag. Ant X to Dromio and gives it to him. 1 Mer break to P|S and face U|S.</quote> This full detail, some of it recording what common sense demands (giving and receiving the money bag), perhaps is the result of Williams’s having to get this production ready under emergency conditions, Paul Scofield’s inability to play Lear (above, <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0047"/>).</p>

<p>The stage consisted of a podium at the rear, a rostrum of two levels four steps lower, and a forestage or proscenium lower still. There is no scenery; the locked door (3.1) is mimed. The wittiest direction is the introduction to 2.1: <quote>[Luciana] carries a small felt board with patience [solitaire] cards which she begins to prepare</quote>—witty because she urges patience on the impatient Adriana.</p>

<p>The language of the play is practically untouched, the changes being in the nature of <quote>lighter</quote> for <hi rend="italic">lesser</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0111">111</ref>), <quote>unstain’d</quote> for <hi rend="italic">distain’d</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0541">541</ref>), and <quote>Who</quote> for <hi rend="italic">That</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1829">1829</ref>); <quote>Thirtie three</quote> is changed to <hi rend="italic">Twenty three</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1890">1890</ref>). Most surprising is the single cut of <quote><quote>Fly pride,</quote> says the peacock, mistress, that you know</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1262" targetEnd="#tln_1263">1262–3</ref>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_halw1979"><name type="app">Halstead</name></ref>, who collates the 1963 revival, records a few more cuts.</p>

<p>Nunn’s 1977 production at the Aldwych cuts fewer than 100 lines, though many are used as songs. The play begins with the Duke’s <quote>I am not partial to infringe our laws</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0008">8</ref>), followed by Egeon’s opening lines, then <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0009" targetEnd="#tln_0014">9–14</ref>, minus <quote>Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more,</quote> which is moved to follow <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0023">23</ref>. The cuts of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0068">68</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0072" targetEnd="#tln_0078">72–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0101" targetEnd="#tln_0102">101–2</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0122" targetEnd="#tln_0124">122–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0143" targetEnd="#tln_0144">143–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0155">155</ref>, and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0161" targetEnd="#tln_0162">161–2</ref> pare away awkwardnesses, especially <quote>Try all the friends thou hast in <hi rend="italic">Ephesus</hi></quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0155">155</ref>), which seems silly considering that Egeon has just arrived after his five-year search for his sons. Well, perhaps a merchant might have business associates, a consideration that may explain why none of the other acting versions considered cuts the line. But he does not sound confident about getting the money.</p>

<p>Act 1 ends with the first song, <title level="a">Beg Thou,</title> a setting of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0156" targetEnd="#tln_0157">156–7</ref>, performed while the stage is transformed into an outdoor cafe. In 1.2, only the joke about scoring on posts (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0229" targetEnd="#tln_0230">229–30</ref>) is cut. In 2.1, the rhymed couplet <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0300" targetEnd="#tln_0301">300–1</ref> is cut, making way for <title level="a">Liberty Song,</title> set from <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0304" targetEnd="#tln_0316">304–16</ref>. The garbled <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0385" targetEnd="#tln_0389">385–9</ref> disappear. In 2.2, following <quote>porridge</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0493">493</ref>) comes the setting of the jokes on time and baldness (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0494" targetEnd="#tln_0502">494–502</ref>), though the lines are not canceled as they are for all the other songs. The scene ends with <title level="a">Am I on Earth,</title> set from <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0608" targetEnd="#tln_0612">608–12</ref>.</p>

<p>Act 3.1 is the last before the interval; cuts include <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0713" targetEnd="#tln_0714">713–14</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0725" targetEnd="#tln_0726">725–6</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0756" targetEnd="#tln_0757">756–7</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0762" targetEnd="#tln_0763">762–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0766" targetEnd="#tln_0767">766–7</ref>. The pattern of cutting, usually involving no more than a single obscure speech, continues in the second part. Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana provides <title level="a">Why Call You Me Love,</title> a duet setting of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_0839" targetEnd="#tln_0860">839–60</ref>. S. Antipholus’s wondering report of his treatment in Ephesus (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1184" targetEnd="#tln_1194">1184–94</ref>) is set as <title level="a">Everywhere I Go.</title> In 4.4, E. Dromio’s lament over his unceasing punishment (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1310" targetEnd="#tln_1320">1310–20</ref>) is set as <title level="a">Beats Me.</title> Lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1414" targetEnd="#tln_1415">1414–15</ref> are bracketed, with <title level="a">Pinch Song and Dance</title> written opposite them. Act 5 stands nearly untouched. Of the cuts, <quote>the Diall points at fiue</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1587">1587</ref>), cut by Smock Alley but then allowed to stand until Komisarjevsky (whose set prominently features a clock), must seem unintelligible; and Egeon’s complaint about the transforming power of age (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1788" targetEnd="#tln_1798">1788–98</ref>) might cause unwanted merriment and is usually trimmed, from Smock Alley onward. Opposite <title level="a">Thirtie three</title> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1890">1890</ref>) is a firmly written 25. The last song is <title level="a">Hand in Hand</title> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1917" targetEnd="#tln_1919">1917–19</ref>).</p>

<p>These prompt-books record the theatrical tastes of their eras, from a time beginning in the Restoration, when <title level="m">Err.</title> could be cut to the barest of bones and serve as an after-piece lasting less than an hour, to Hull’s 18th-c. rewriting to make up for Sh.’s perceived deficiencies, to an increasing willingness to accept the play as it appears in <siglum>F1</siglum>. In this history, <title level="m">Err.</title>’s fate is no, or not much, different from those of Sh.’s other plays.</p>

<head>Irregular, Doubtful, and Emended Accidentals in <siglum>F1</siglum></head>

<p>For an explanation of the contents of this list, see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0001-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0001-b"/>. In the notes, the lemma is the reading of this edition’s text. For emendations, the lemma is followed by the siglum of the edition from which the emendation is drawn and then by the rejected <siglum>F1</siglum> reading and the sigla of the 17th-c. editions reading differently from the lemma. If no source is given for the emendation, the reading adopted is to be found in none of the folios. Doubtful and irregular readings are merely listed. (&verbar;) indicates that the reading is found in a full line; (?) indicates dubiety or an alternative to the reading adopted, although not a correct one in the judgment of the editor. In notes pertaining to variants in punctuation, a swung dash (&swdash;) shows that a word in the lemma is replaced in substantially the same form, and an inferior caret (&caret;) calls attention to a lack of punctuation.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0056">That Sh. was not the author of the entirety of <title level="m">WT</title> was casually suggested by <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pope1"><name type="app">Pope</name></ref> (ed. 1725, 1:xx): <quote>I make no doubt to declare that those wretched plays [such as <title level="m">Pericles</title>, added to the canon in <siglum>F3</siglum>], cannot be admitted as his. And I should conjecture of some of the others, (particularly <title level="m">Love’s Labour Lost</title>, <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>, and <title level="m">Titus Andronicus</title>) that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few particular passages, were of his hand.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_robj30"><name type="app">Robertson</name></ref> (1930, pp. 133–4), a more dedicated disintegrator, also finds <title level="m">WT</title> unworthy. Time’s prologue (lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1579" targetEnd="#tln_1611">1579–1611</ref>) <quote>has quite an un-Shakespearean aspect. The <quote>I mentioned</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1601">1601</ref>], further, implies a previous prologue, which has been dropped. Perhaps the clearest ground for suspecting a non-Shakespearean hand is the rhyming of <quote>after</quote> with <quote>daughter</quote>, a thing unexampled in Shakespeare’s serious work, but emphatically of a kind of perverse rhyming much affected by Chapman.</quote> (For the rhyme, see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1559">1606–7.</ref>) <quote>The chief æsthetic difficulty of the play,</quote> Leontes’s sudden jealousy, <quote>is not <quote>like</quote> [<hi rend="italic">134</hi>] Shakespeare.&hellip;It would be a more satisfying solution if&hellip;the unnaturally rapid action had been imposed by a previous constructor, of whom we seem to find plain traces.</quote></p>

<p>The critical problems <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_robj30"><name type="app">Robertson</name></ref> discovers have concerned others (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_218">181–92</ref> for Leontes’s jealousy, for example), but no one else attributes the apparent disparities to a previous constructor. <title level="m">WT</title> is generally regarded as authentically Sh.’s. Some critics who accept this opinion believe, nevertheless, that the play as it stands is a revision of a version in which Hermione really dies. See, for example, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cra31c"><name type="app">Craig</name></ref> (<title level="m">Revisions</title>, 1931, pp. 347–8) and, for a more recent expression of the idea, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mue71"><name type="app">Mueller</name></ref> (1971).</p>

<div type="level2" xml:id="div_text_1623version">
<head>The 1623 Version of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title></head>

<p>The printing of the First Folio (1623), in which <title level="m">WT</title> was originally published, has been analyzed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wile32"><name type="app">Willoughby</name></ref> (1932), by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shrj56"><name type="app">Shroeder</name></ref> (1956), and, most thoroughly and expertly, by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> (1963), on whose work much of this account is based. On 8 November 1623, close to the publication date of <title level="m">Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies</title>, sixteen of the plays were entered in the Stationers’ Register to Edward Blount and Isaac Jaggard (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_arb1875"><name type="app">Arber</name>, 1875–94, 4:69</ref>). Blount, a publisher and bookseller, was the leading member of the syndicate sponsoring publication of the First Folio. Isaac Jaggard, a printer, publisher, and bookseller, had replaced his late father, William, as a principal member of the syndicate. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsf25"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (1925) believes that because of William’s blindness and failing health in 1622–3, Isaac was the chief overseer of the printing of the collection. The entry covers <quote>soe manie of the said Copies as are not formerly entred to other men</quote> and lists, according to their order in the Folio, eight comedies, two histories, and six tragedies.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0037"><title level="m">WT</title> is the last of the comedies named in the entry; it is also the last play in the first section of <siglum>F1</siglum> (the Comedies), where it occupies sigs. Aa1–Cc2 (pages 277–303); gathering Cc is a single sheet. The play is preceded by <title level="m">AWW</title> (sigs. V1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>–Y1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>) and <title level="m">TN</title> (Y2–Z6). The text of <title level="m">WT</title>, which concludes in the top third of Cc2, is followed by <quote>The Names of the Actors.</quote> Sixteen characters are identified by name, and <hi rend="italic"><quote>Other Lords, and Gentlemen, and Seruants. Shepheards, and Shephearddesses</quote></hi> covers the rest (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3370" targetEnd="#tln_3388">3370–88</ref>). Among the Comedies, the first, second, and fourth plays—<title level="m">Tmp.</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>, and <title level="m">MM</title>—are equipped with similar dramatis personae, and all were probably typeset from manuscripts in the hand of the scribe Ralph Crane, of whom more below. He may have compiled these lists, although <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_eccm80"><name type="app">Eccles</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">MM</title>, 1980, p. 3, n. 2940) points out that in the case of a work by Webster, Crane <quote>is more likely to have copied than to have originated the list printed in [<title level="m">The Duchess of Malfi</title>] in 1623 [from another Crane transcript], since it names&hellip;actors&hellip;who had died in 1614, and&hellip;in 1619.</quote> <title level="m">Wiv.</title>, the third play in the Comedies section and probably another Crane copy, lacks space for such a list.</p>

<p>Beneath <quote>The Names of the Actors</quote> in <title level="m">WT</title> is the satyr tailpiece, in which a small defect acquired during the course of the <siglum>F1</siglum> printing shows that the last page of <title level="m">Jn.</title> (b5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>) was printed before the last page of <title level="m">TN</title> (Z6) and the last page of <title level="m">WT</title> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name>, 1:179–80</ref>). Sig. Cc2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> is blank. Since the play following <title level="m">WT</title> in the Folio is <title level="m">Jn.</title>, the first of the history plays, the blank may seem to have been left so that the Histories section of the book could begin on a recto. This nicety, however, was actually compelled by the fact that <title level="m">Jn.</title> and part of <title level="m">R2</title>, which follows <title level="m">Jn.</title>, had been printed before the typesetting of <title level="m">WT</title> began (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref>, 1:37). It is more extraordinary that the first page of <title level="m">WT</title> is preceded by blank Z6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hunj1845"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> (1845, 1:417) suggests that there was <quote>some danger of losing this play. In the folio collection there is a blank page following <title level="m">Twelfth Night</title>, as if there the collection of comedies ended, and the histories were about to begin: and my copy of the first folio actually wants the <title level="m">Winter’s Tale</title>.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pol09"><name type="app">Pollard</name></ref> (1909, p. 135) thought there had been simply a miscalculation of the space required for <title level="m">TN</title>, but the anomaly seems to arise from another and more complicated cause.</p>

<p>As <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> (2:521) explains—repeating to some extent the conclusions of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wile32"><name type="app">Willoughby</name></ref> (1932, pp. 34–43)—when <title level="m">AWW</title> was nearly completed, Compositor B, who had been working alone on that play, skipped to the Histories. With Compositor C he set all of <title level="m">Jn.</title>, which begins at sig. a1, and then two pages of <title level="m">R2</title>, b6–6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>. B at that point returned to the Comedies. By himself he finished <title level="m">AWW</title> and <title level="m">TN</title>, which concluded on Z6. He then set two more pages of <title level="m">R2</title> and, after an interruption for work on another book, with Compositor A set ten more pages of <title level="m">R2</title> and proceeded to <title level="m">WT</title>. The blank Z6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> is thus a legacy of the excursions from the Comedies into the Histories and back again, sheet Z having been printed before copy for <title level="m">WT</title> was available. (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shrj56"><name type="app">Shroeder</name></ref>, p. 42, notices another minor consequence: In the first sheet of <title level="m">Jn.</title> to be printed, sig. a3 is designated Aa3, in the style of the signature alphabet to be used later for <title level="m">WT</title>.) <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> continues: <quote>For some reason the copy for <title level="m">Twelfth Night</title> was not readily available when quire X was finished (though it evidently became so soon afterward), and&hellip;the copy for <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> was in like manner unavailable when quire Z was finished (though on this occasion the want was made good even more quickly than before).&hellip;No difficulty over copyright can be supposed—only some short-lived trouble over the copy itself.</quote> He thus puts to rest several earlier speculations, such as that of <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_wh1"><name type="app">White</name></ref> (ed. 1857, 5:275): <quote>It is possible that in gathering the plays together Heminge and Condell forgot this one [<title level="m">WT</title>] until the folio was nearly in type; but it is more probable that, finding it no more tragical [i.e., less so] in its course or its catastrophe than <title level="m">Cymbeline</title>, they first intended to class it with the Tragedies [as <title level="m">Cym.</title> is], and after it was ready to be struck off restored it to its proper place among the Comedies.</quote> Equally groundless is the explanation of <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1898"><name type="app">Furness</name></ref> (ed. 1898, p. vii) that <quote>inasmuch as the sheets were printed off&hellip;at different presses [he seems to be referring, incorrectly, to printing houses], it was undoubtedly easier to leave a whole page blank at the end of a signature than to transfer a single page of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> to the press that was striking off <title level="m">Twelfth Night</title>.</quote></p>

For <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt73"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1973, pp. 84–7), however, it is uncertain that <quote>the A of the early comedies and the A of <title level="m">WT</title> and the histories [are] the same compositor.&hellip;The compositor of <title level="m">WT</title> prefers <quote>indeed</quote>, <quote>mistresse</quote>, [and in elisions] <quote>x’th</quote>, and <quote>x’le</quote> whereas in A’s pages of <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, <title level="m">TGV</title>, <title level="m">Wiv.</title>, <title level="m">MM</title> and <title level="m">MV</title> the corresponding preferences are <quote>indeede</quote>, <quote>mistris</quote>, <quote>x’th/xth</quote>, and <quote>x’ll</quote>.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt73"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> also finds (p. 85) that, with respect to <hi rend="italic">chuse</hi> (two instances in <title level="m">WT</title>) / <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">deare</hi> (2) / <hi rend="italic">deere</hi> (2), <hi rend="italic">deuil(l)</hi> (2) / <hi rend="italic">diuell</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">graunt</hi> (1) / <hi rend="italic">grant</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">grief</hi>(<hi rend="italic">ue</hi>) (8) / <hi rend="italic">greef</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ue</hi>) (0), <hi rend="italic">Heauen</hi> (11) / <hi rend="italic">heauen</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">howre</hi> (0) / <hi rend="italic">houre</hi> (1), <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> (10) / <hi rend="italic">indeede</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">mistresse</hi> (7) / <hi rend="italic">mistris</hi> (2), <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi> (1) / <hi rend="italic">scarse</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">suddaine</hi> (1) / <hi rend="italic">sodaine</hi> (0), <hi rend="italic">yeere</hi> (7) / <hi rend="italic">yeare</hi> (0), and <hi rend="italic">young</hi> (8) / <hi rend="italic">yong</hi> (0), Compositor A of <title level="m">R2</title> and <title level="m">WT</title> preferred the first form and Compositor A of the earlier Comedies the second. As the figures indicate, though, not all of these preferences are expressed powerfully or even at all in <title level="m">WT</title> alone.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0050"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt73"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> explains his differentiation between the two Compositors A (pp. 86–7): <quote>Whereas the comedies compositor would quite often space a fair number of internal commas, occasionally more than were left without spaces, the practice of the [<hi rend="italic">87</hi>] histories A is much more pronounced and never, in the plays&hellip;examined, is there a greater number of spaced commas to unspaced commas.&hellip; Also, before <title level="m">WT</title>, the compositor A [of the Comedies] was indifferent to whether he set the first word of the speech together with the speech-prefix in a catchword, or the speech-prefix alone, but in the histories his invariable practice was to supply the first word of the dialogue with which the next page started.</quote> In <title level="m">WT</title>, catchwords consisting of speech prefix and a word of dialogue are found on Aa3, Aa5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, Bb5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, and Cc1, all attributed to A, whereas abbreviated speech prefixes only are found on Aa4, Bb1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, Bb2, and Bb2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, all attributed to B. The Compositor A of <title level="m">WT</title> thus appears to be the Compositor A of the Histories, not the Compositor A of the earlier Comedies. The latter was designated F by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt73"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1973, p. 87). But <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wer84"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1984, p. 92), noticing that in the text assigned to Compositor F, portions of prose speeches that <quote>mark a change of address or of topic</quote> may be given a new line, a characteristic of Compositor D, wonders whether <quote>any distinction can be made between the two workmen.</quote> (The subject awaits further investigation.) Moreover, the validity of spacing as a compositorial discriminant has been questioned by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mck59"><name type="app">McKenzie</name></ref> (1984). He found that its apparent testimony in early books printed at the Cambridge University Press does not accord with the work records kept.</p>

<p>About the order of composition there is little different from the regular procedure for typesetting <siglum>F1</siglum>. The manuscript text would be cast off—that is, before typesetting began, the words of the manuscript would be allotted to specific type pages—so that the two compositors could work more or less simultaneously. Both started with the innermost forme; and then one of them usually worked backward through the page sequence of each quire and the other forward. Since much of the text is regular verse, its casting off amounted to little more than counting the number of verse lines needed to fill the two columns of each page. Even on pages largely of prose (e.g., Bb1–2), white lines left above and below stage directions and scene heads permitted expansion or contraction, so that the typeset words could be fitted into the estimated space. Nothing shows what B did while A set Aa1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>–2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, 5<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>–6 by himself.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0070">The few irregularities are minor. On Aa1, the first page of the play but the last of the Aa gathering set by Compositor A, the white space preceding and following <hi rend="italic">Scœna Secunda</hi>, near the foot of column a, is reduced, to allow plenty of room for the ornament, head title, and initial entrance direction at the top of the page and to avoid having the scene head or the initial SD stand alone at the foot of the column. At <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_467">467</ref> (Aa2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>b), perhaps to gain a couple of lines, an entrance direction, rather than being centered, is set on the same line as the conclusion of a speech—or, if the direction had been overlooked earlier, it could have been inserted there after the column was in type. SDs similarly placed are found at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2005">2005</ref> (Compositor B) and at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3029">3029</ref> (Compositor A). On Bb3a there are about two lines of white space above and below Autolycus’s song (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2044" targetEnd="#tln_2055">2044–55</ref>), but on Bb3b his second song in the scene (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2139" targetEnd="#tln_2144">2139–44</ref>) is crowded into the text: A one-line speech has been run into the concluding line of another speech (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2138">2138</ref>); the logotype <quote>y<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></quote> is used (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2146">2146</ref>, its only appearance in <title level="m">WT</title>, although <quote>y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi></quote> is found at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1672">1672</ref>); and probably line <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2080">2080</ref> has been moved from the head of column b to the foot of column a, where it now occupies the direction line, normally blank in column a. Lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2145" targetEnd="#tln_2146">2145–6</ref> may have been reset. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_paf61"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> (1961, p. 173) suspects <quote>some mistake in the casting off or else some later insertion, perhaps the song.</quote> The latter seems likely, and if the song was overlooked, it may have been written on a piece of paper not a part of the main MS. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_paf61"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> suggests, too, that the typesetting of Bb3 was done by Compositor E, supposed to be an apprentice, but <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt73"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> disagree. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_paf61"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref>’s opinion, however, is shared by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cai72"><name type="app">Cairncross</name></ref> (1972, p. 382).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_harrg48"><name type="app">Harrison</name></ref> (1948, p. 242) argues that <quote>in his later plays not only did Shakespeare abandon blank verse in conversation, but in the longer speeches he often substituted for the normal pattern of five feet&hellip;a much freer short line verse.</quote> This opinion is reiterated by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bertp81"><name type="app">Bertram</name></ref> (1981), who urges modern editors to forgo relining as iambic pentameter the apparently irregular verse of the early eds. In doing so, he says, they obscure Sh.’s rhetorical instructions to the actors, instructions that are embodied in the lineation of the early texts. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wer84"><name type="app">Werstine</name></ref> (1984), investigating whether the line division in the Folio is Sh.’s or the F compositors’, finds that in the late plays, including <title level="m">WT</title>, departures from iambic pentameter are usually caused by the compositors’ need to create or waste space to make cast-off copy fit its typographical allocation. The irregular lineation has nothing to do with rhetorical instructions.</p>

<head>The <siglum>F1</siglum> Copy</head>

<p xml:id="para_0002">According to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew57"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1957, 3:1111), <quote>There is external evidence of trouble over the copy for this play [<title level="m">WT</title>], for on 19 Aug. 1623 the Master of the Revels relicensed the piece since <quote>the allowed booke was missing[e]</quote> [see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0001"/>], though by that time the play must have been already printed.</quote> And it probably was; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hin63"><name type="app">Hinman</name></ref> (1:357) believes that the work on quires c and Aa–Cc <quote>may well have</quote> taken place in December 1622. (Earlier scholarship, summarized by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew55"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref>, 1955, p. 461, arrived at nearly the same date, late November.) Even though the manuscript of <title level="m">WT</title> bearing the original license had been lost, however, at least one other copy existed to provide a basis both for the production with which the Master of the Revels, Sir Henry Herbert, was concerned and for <siglum>F1</siglum> printer’s copy. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wile1899"><name type="app">Willoughby</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3"><name type="app">J. D. Wilson</name></ref>, ed. 1931, p. 113 n.) suggests that what Herbert actually saw was the printed sheets of <title level="m">WT</title>. This is possible, of course; as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew55"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1955, p. 417 n.) points out, though, <quote>they would have needed a lot of editing [presumably the addition of bookkeeper’s notes for control of the performance and perhaps the cutting of dialogue] and have provided very little room for it.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_knor00"><name type="app">Knowles</name></ref> (privately) suggests that <quote>the company may have retrieved from Jaggard the Crane transcript.</quote> That is also a possibility. Manuscript returned by modern letterpress printers may be too marked up and inky for theatrical use, but the copy for the 1591 English translation of <title level="m">Orlando Furioso</title>, as described by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew24"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1924), is quite neat. In that case, however, it may have made a difference that the manuscript was being received by Sir John Harington, the translator. Because the <siglum>F1</siglum> text has no theatrical stigmata, there is no support for the opinion, voiced by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lee02"><name type="app">Lee</name></ref> (1902, p. xxvi), that <quote>after being represented on the stage,</quote> the MS version of the play licensed by Herbert <quote>was sent to press.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0055">In his <title level="m">TGV</title>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsjo21"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1921, p. 78) had argued that <quote>the <quote>copy</quote> for <title level="m">The Two Gentlemen</title> was made up by stringing together players’ parts and arranging them in acts and scenes by the aid of a <quote>plot.</quote></quote> A <hi rend="italic">plot</hi> in this sense was an outline of the action of a play, recording entrances and exits, properties, noises, and other details of performance of which the prompter wanted to be reminded (for further information, see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew22"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref>, 1922). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsjo21"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>’s idea was quickly adapted to <title level="m">WT</title>. Because, in his opinion, <title level="m">WT</title> has <quote>no stage-directions, or very few,</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rhor22"><name type="app">Rhodes</name></ref> (1922, pp. 59–60) asserts that the text cannot <quote>have been set up by the printer from the prompt-book.</quote> It was, instead, (p. 60) <quote>assembled</quote> from the players’ parts, <quote>complete with cue, dialogue, and certain directions, and&hellip;a detailed extract from the stage-directions to serve as his [the prompter’s] remembrancer</quote>—that is, the plot. The plot would furnish a <quote>guide for sorting the players’ parts and keeping them in order whilst pasting them together into one continuous text,</quote> which would, however, <quote>inevitably lack many directions.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rhor22"><name type="app">Rhodes</name></ref> finds that <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>bears all the stigmata of an <quote>assembled</quote> text. The entrances of the players are not, as usual, distributed in the places where they are due to appear, but each scene is headed by a list of characters.&hellip;In all the five acts there are not more than a dozen incidental entrances and exits, and those are mostly of minor characters.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0004">The same idea is expressed more fully by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rhor23"><name type="app">Rhodes</name></ref> (1923, pp. 98–100), and, after it receives favorable mention by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pol23"><name type="app">Pollard</name></ref> (1923, p. 8), is reiterated by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsjo24"><name type="app">J. D. Wilson</name></ref> (1924, pp. 72–6). This view, reflecting <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_joh1756"><name type="app">Johnson</name></ref>’s (1756; 1968, 7:52) opinion that Sh.’s plays were <quote>printed&hellip;from compilations made by chance or by stealth out of the separate parts written for the theatre,</quote> was obviously influenced by <title level="m">TGV</title>’s and <title level="m">WT</title>’s massed entries (that is, the lists at the head of a scene not only of the characters who appear at its beginning but also of those who enter later). <title level="m">WT</title> has massed entries at 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.1, and 5.3. The characters are listed according to social rank or importance in the drama in 2.1 (in two groups) and 5.3 but in the approximate order of their speaking in 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.4. In 5.1, those present at the beginning are in order of rank; Florizel and Perdita, named last, enter later. Plays in the Ben Jonson folio (1616) also have massed entries, as do the quartos from which the folio texts derive. In Webster’s <title level="m">Duchess of Malfi</title> (1623), according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bal31"><name type="app">Bald</name></ref> (1931–2, pp. 244–6), occasionally a character named in a massed entry fails to appear in the scene; and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew31a"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1931–2) reports that in Massinger’s autograph MS of <title level="m">Believe as you List</title>, a massed entry includes characters who enter later. In these instances, players’ parts cannot have been involved unless, as in the case of <title level="m">BAYL</title>, the point of entry was specified in another direction or could be deduced from another feature of the text. In any event, parts do not seem to have been involved in <title level="m">WT</title>.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0051">Although it was endorsed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3"><name type="app">J. D. Wilson</name></ref> in his 1931 ed. of <title level="m">WT</title> (p. 122), the theory of assembled texts was to collapse under its impracticalities. (For a history of its career, see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew55"><name type="app">Greg</name>, 1955, pp. 156–8</ref>.) Speculation about the fate of <title level="m">WT</title>’s allowed book continued, however. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adaj17"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1917, p. 25, n. 2) guesses that the MS was <quote>misplaced by the printer</quote> of <siglum>F1</siglum>.

In the decade following <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adaj17"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref>’s study, though, <title level="m">WT</title>’s textual history began to be understood differently. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew26"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1926, p. 154) found that the manuscripts of Fletcher and Massinger’s <title level="m">Barnavelt</title> and Middleton’s <title level="m">The Witch</title> (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0003"/>) were in the same handwriting, and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsf26"><name type="app">F. P. Wilson</name></ref> (1926–7) proved that the hand was that of Ralph Crane, a scrivener associated with the King’s Men, who had signed his name to his transcript of Fletcher’s <title level="m">Demetrius and Enanthe; or, The Humorous Lieutenant</title> (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0003"/>). To this signed document, Crane’s other surviving work, some also signed, is linked by distinctive and recurrent stylistic features. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsf26"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref>’s attribution of the Folio copy of <title level="m">WT</title> to Crane was attacked unsuccessfuly by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tan33"><name type="app">Tannenbaum</name></ref> (1933, pp. 75–86), who mistakenly thought the MS was <quote>quite possibly Shakespeare’s own manuscript.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilsf26"><name type="app">F. P. Wilson</name></ref> (1926–7, pp. 211–14) describes <quote>some general characteristics of [Crane’s] work. 1. A publisher who came by one of Crane’s transcripts might reasonably expect from the printer an accurate text.&hellip;2. All Crane’s transcripts are carefully divided into acts and scenes.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">212</hi>] 3. Those stage-directions in <title level="m">Barnavelt</title> which are in Crane’s handwriting give little information apart from mere statements of exits and entrances [Fletcher and Massinger’s <title level="m">Barnavelt</title> is preserved in British Library MS Add. 18653; see <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_bow66">Fredson Bowers</ref>, ed., in <title level="m">The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon</title>, 8:485–501].&hellip;In Crane’s other transcripts the directions never smack of the theatre.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">214</hi>] Statements of entrances are massed together at the head of each scene.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:488–9) finds that the SDs in <title level="m">WT</title> consist of <quote>little more than entries and exits, and the latter are often omitted. The entries are normally given in [4.3] and [5.2], but for the other scenes all the characters taking part, whether they are present from the beginning or not, are grouped in the initial entry. This follows the order of their appearance, and in [2.1, 3.2, 5.1, and 5.3], but not elsewhere, the successively appearing characters or [<hi rend="italic">489</hi>] groups of characters are marked off by colons in the stage-directions.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1972, p. 130) points out that the massed directions with colons were typeset by Compositor A, those without by Compositor B, who <quote>was apparently unwilling to print the colons from copy.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0046">The entrance directions are of four types. The first, reflecting English tradition, marks entrances as the characters appear (4.3 and 5.2). The second, reflecting neoclassical tradition, includes some of the massed entries discussed earlier (<ptr targType="p" target="#para_0004"/>). In this type, all the characters appearing in the scene are named in the initial SD, although some actually enter later; their entrances are unmarked (2.1, 2.2, and 3.2; the SD for 3.2 omits Paulina, unless she is included among the Ladies, and the Servant who enters at 1323). The third is neutral: all characters who appear in the scene are present from the beginning (1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, and 5.3). The fourth is hybrid: all who appear in the scene are named in the initial entry but some actually enter later, and their entrance is marked (2.3, 3.3 [except for the Shepherd who enters at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1501">1501</ref>], 4.4 [except for the Servant who enters at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2145">2145</ref>], and 5.1 [except for the Lord who enters at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2940">2940</ref>]). Since the stage directions in all the Shn. texts thought to be printed from foul papers are in the English style and since there is no reason to think that Jaggard would have introduced the neoclassical, Crane must be its source and the source of the inconsistencies as well.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0040">The fundamental study of Crane’s work is <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1972), which superseded such earlier studies as that of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_som62"><name type="app">Somer</name></ref> (1962). A summary of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name>’s</ref> and other research on Crane is provided by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_haa89"><name type="app">Haas</name></ref> (1989). Eight of Crane’s dramatic manuscripts survive, three being of Middleton’s <title level="m">A Game at Chess</title>. Three additional MS copies of this play, one in Middleton’s hand, also exist, and comparison of Crane’s versions with Middleton’s affords an unusual opportunity to isolate many details attributable to the scribe rather than to the copy from which he worked. Eight nondramatic transcripts in Crane’s hand have also survived, and comparison of these and the dramatic transcripts permits more characteristics of Crane’s work to be identified. Those evident in <title level="m">WT</title> include The Names of the Actors (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3370" targetEnd="#tln_3388">3370–88</ref>) and the massed entrances mentioned above; division of the text into acts and scenes; descriptive stage directions (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0005"/>); some characteristic spellings (the very common <hi rend="italic">’em</hi>; see below for many more); the Jonsonian elision at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_109">109</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Verely’is</hi>); numerous hyphens linking, for example, prepositions and objects, prefixes and stems, adverbs and adjectives, adjectives and substantives, and stems and suffixes (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_6">6</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_17">17</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_24">24</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_30">30</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_50">50</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_73">73</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_79">79</ref>, etc.); and, according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (p. 82), huge quantities of colons and parentheses, 839 of the former and 371 of the latter. He points out (p. 87) that <quote>of the possible situations where parentheses [to enclose vocatives] could have been used,</quote> 39% of the vocatives in <title level="m">WT</title> have them. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel87"><name type="app">Wells</name> &amp; <name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (p. 601) add <quote>parentheses to mark passages spoken aside</quote> at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2516" targetEnd="#tln_2517">2516–17</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2520">2520</ref>. Crane may not be entirely responsible for the text’s numerous hyphens, however; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mck59"><name type="app">McKenzie</name></ref> (1959, p. 81) finds that in setting <title level="m">MV</title> Q2 (1619), <quote>Compositor B</quote> hyphenated such words as <hi rend="italic">bed-fellow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">me-thinks</hi> 25 times and deleted the hyphen in his copy only 9 times. (While John F.

Of all these spellings, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kab68"><name type="app">Kable</name></ref> (1968, pp. 157–9) found <hi rend="italic">extreames</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1804">1804</ref>), <hi rend="italic">howre</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1587">1587</ref>), and <hi rend="italic">moneth</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2089">2089</ref>) to be contrary to Compositor B’s preference, hence his copy spellings. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kab68"><name type="app">Kable</name></ref>’s opinion, however, is compromised by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_know82"><name type="app">R.

<p>The two plays also display some similarities in punctuation. In <title level="m">WT</title> as in <title level="m">MM</title>, colons are preferred to semicolons, although more strongly (1 per 29 words, as opposed to 1 per 140 in <title level="m">MM</title>). The exclamation point does not appear. Sometimes the question mark is exclamatory (at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_265">265</ref>, for example), but in many instances its exclamatory function cannot be distinguished clearly from its interrogative one. One difference from <title level="m">MM</title> and the transcripts is that the suffix is nearly always -<hi rend="italic">nesse</hi> in <title level="m">WT</title>; only one -<hi rend="italic">nes</hi> is found, in <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1663">1663</ref>, a full line.</p>

<head>Crane’s Copy</head>

<p>Because Crane exerted such a strong influence on the form of the texts he transcribed, it is not surprising that critics find it difficult to penetrate his version of <title level="m">WT</title> as it is represented in <siglum>F1</siglum>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew55"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1955, pp. 416–17) believes that <title level="m">WT</title> was late reaching the printer only because of the time required to make for Jaggard a transcript of the foul papers, an opinion with which <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_evns"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref> (ed. 1974, p. 1604) agrees. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt65"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1965, p. 340), having protested against too facile an acceptance of numerous parentheses as indicative of Crane’s transcription, suggests, nevertheless, that the number in <title level="m">WT</title> may indicate that the play was printed from a Crane transcript of his own earlier transcript, an idea developed further by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt66"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> a year later (1966, p. 140). When, according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt66"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref>, <quote>copy was being gathered for the Folio, Crane was given foul papers for <title level="m">Winter’s Tale</title> with instructions to prepare also the promptbook for playhouse use. Crane prepared the promptbook first before making the transcript for the printer for by so doing he would release the foul papers in the shortest possible time to return to the security of the players’ collection of manuscripts. Had he prepared the Folio copy before the promptbook, we should not have the clean and sophisticated text, showing an unusually large number of parentheses, that we find in the Folio. On the same evidence, Crane apparently retained the promptbook, but probably returned the foul papers, so that he would avoid having to make both transcripts from foul papers.&hellip;He chose, therefore, to delay delivery of the Folio copy, perhaps thinking, or indeed knowing, that the printers had enough to go on with. [<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt92"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1992, p. 128) conjectures that the delay arose from Crane’s occupation with his transcript of Webster’s <title level="m">Duchess of Malfi</title>.] From this order of events, we get a good, clean, literary text, with an unusually high number of parentheses consistent with other Crane transcripts from his own earlier papers, and, of course, a delay which affected the printing of <title level="m">Winter’s Tale</title> in the First Folio.</quote> In his major work on Crane, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1972, p. 131) adds, <quote>The massed entries [appearing in <siglum>F1</siglum> and deriving from the printer’s copy] would have been out of place in a copy made for a promptbook but [they] easily could have been compiled from a transcript with conventional entries. Why he [Crane] should choose massed entries when he had a clean manuscript available is not readily explained, but the variety of the directions argues that the copy was prepared in some haste, under conditions which did not allow the scribe to adopt the massed convention completely.</quote></p>

<p>The idea that the <title level="m">WT</title> copy was a transcript of a transcript had appeared earlier in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt65"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1965, pp. 337–8). The number of <title level="m">WT</title>’s parentheses (371, 268), the article indicates, is substantially greater than that in the other Folio Comedies believed to have been set from Crane manuscripts—<rs type="sh" key="Tmp."><title level="m">Tmp.</title> 98 (115)</rs>, <rs type="sh" key="TGV"><title level="m">TGV</title> 128 (150)</rs>, <rs type="sh" key="Wiv."><title level="m">Wiv.</title> 218 (241)</rs>, and <rs type="sh" key="MM"><title level="m">MM</title> 75 (78)</rs>; the first figure is the actual incidence and the second, the actual adjusted for the length of the plays. Since the Folio compositors did not have an identical fondness for parentheses, the figures adjusted for length become, when further adjusted to allow for Compositor A’s preference, <title level="m">Tmp.</title> 116, <title level="m">TGV</title> 131, <title level="m">Wiv.</title> 308, and <title level="m">MM</title> 62, in contrast to <title level="m">WT</title>’s 415. Moreover, Crane’s several transcripts of <title level="m">A Game at Chess</title> indicate that every time Crane recopied a text, he <quote>tended to reproduce the parentheses of his copy, but added to them, and&hellip;added more parentheses when he was transcribing from his own copy</quote> (p. 336). The <title level="m">WT</title> transcript, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1972, p. 70) observes, <quote>must have been made after any other transcripts he made for the Folio. Therefore the scribe’s habits would have been influenced both by the character of the copy before him, and by his increasing familiarity with the kind of material he had to work from.</quote></p>

<p>A question about this theory arises from the massed entries. If they were undesirable in a promptbook, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> says, and if the <title level="m">WT</title> promptbook was created before the printer’s copy, would Crane, having copied in the first transcript the entrances where the play’s action required them, have then taken the trouble to extract and compile these entries for each of the play’s eight scenes they head? The compilation is incomplete, moreover (4.3 and 5.2, which might have been massed, are not), and the style of the massed entries differs (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0004"/>). Crane’s motive would have been professional pride or a classical preference (massed stage directions serve no essential literary or dramatic purpose), which he indulged even though, as noted above, <quote>the copy was prepared in some haste, under conditions which did not allow the scribe to adopt the massed convention completely</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref>, 1972, p. 131). In response, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel87"><name type="app">Wells</name> &amp; <name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (p. 601) state that <quote>as the Folio had been printed [<title level="m">WT</title> in Dec. 1622] long before Herbert saw the new prompt-book [on 19 Aug. 1623], this [<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref>’s explanation] seems unlikely. The original prompt-book might even have been lost as a result of being copied by Crane for the Folio.</quote> They also allude to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thoa34"><name type="app">Thorndike</name></ref>’s idea that the dance of satyrs at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2164">2164</ref> was taken from Jonson’s <title level="m">Oberon</title> (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2059">2164</ref>): <quote>The passage introducing this dance could be omitted without disturbing the dialogue; no one comments upon the dance afterwards; moreover, the Clown’s comment that <quote>My Father, and the Gent. are in sad talke</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2134" targetEnd="#tln_2135">2134–5</ref>] would be naturally followed, after the exit of Autolycus and his clients, by Polixenes’ <quote>O Father, you’l know more of that heereafter</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2165">2165</ref>], which indicates that they have been carrying on a conversation which we have not heard. Polixenes’ comment is not nearly so natural after the satyr dance, since it suggests that he had been talking to the Old Shepherd rather than attending to the dance he had himself insisted upon witnessing [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2156" targetEnd="#tln_2157">2156–7</ref>]. <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0006-a"/>There is no reason to doubt Shakespeare’s authorship of the passage introducing the dance, but it could be a late addition; if so, Crane was copying a prompt-book, and the original composition was earlier than January 1611.</quote> (see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0005-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0005-b"/>.)<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0006-b"/> Regarding the supposed unnaturalness of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2165">2165</ref>, however, not one of the acting editions collated for this edition cuts it (see <ptr targType="div" target="#div_textonstage"/>). Since there are no other traces of Crane’s having copied <title level="m">WT</title>’s promptbook, the apparent anomaly probably arises from an aberration in foul papers, toward which the clothing crux may also point (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2399">2557–8</ref> and <ptr targType="div" target="#div_subs_elopement"/>).</p>

<p>The foul papers of one of Sh.’s compositions—147 lines of <title level="m">Sir Thomas More</title>, a play of uncertain date originally by Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle—may have survived. Having been heavily censored by the Master of the Revels for political reasons, the play was parceled out to several playwrights for salvage. The 147 lines are indeed foul—punctuation lacking, SDs absent or incomplete, SPs mistaken or vague, words omitted, and verse mislined—but they have perhaps created too strong an impression of Sh.’s scribal carelessness. It may be true that Jaggard’s <quote>initial editorial policy called for scribal transcripts to be given to the printer if quartos were not available</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_eccm80"><name type="app">Eccles</name></ref>, ed. <title level="m">MM</title>, 1980, p. 293). Nevertheless, recent critical opinion, as represented by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel87"><name type="app">Wells</name> &amp; <name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (pp. 145–7), is that foul papers more or less certainly were the initial printer’s copy for as many as 17 of the 35 plays included in <siglum>F1</siglum>. If this opinion is correct, the foul papers of <title level="m">WT</title> could have served as Crane’s copy as well.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0003">In about 1625, Crane transcribed Thomas Middleton’s <title level="m">The Witch</title> for a presentation by the author (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew41"><name type="app">Greg</name>, 1941–2</ref>). Three of the songs in this transcript are preserved in other versions. In 1625, Crane made a private transcript of Fletcher’s <title level="m">Demetrius and Enanthe, or the Humorous Lieutenant</title>, which may be compared with the independent text of the play published in the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, a version representing the play as cut for production (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_bow66">Cyrus Hoy, ed., in <title level="m">The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon</title>, 5:293</ref>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nos65"><name type="app">Nosworthy</name></ref> (1965, p. 221), having examined these sources, concludes: <quote>It is clear that Crane, though an elegant scribe, was at times an extraordinarily perfunctory one. Carelessness, combined with strange orthography, occasionally results in misreadings which would have baffled any compositor.&hellip;That he was, like many another scribe, occasionally guilty of sins of omission is a ready inference.&hellip;[Sh.] Folio texts based on Crane transcripts must obviously be viewed with suspicion. He was doubtless responsible for the sprinkling of apparent nonce-words which defy emendation, and there are often grounds for suspecting small omissions.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howt72"><name type="app">Howard-Hill</name></ref> (1972, p. 133) differs, however: <quote>Even when he [Crane] may be suspected of error, the reading of his transcript is at the least plausible. If his sophistication of the texts he transcribed had been less, more could be discovered of the nature of his copy. The <quote>goodness</quote> of&hellip;<title level="m">WT</title> means little more than that the printer’s copy was free from obvious error. The general level of Crane’s accuracy was high, but he was not reluctant to interfere with his text, consciously or unconsciously, when its meaning was obscure to him.</quote> That the <siglum>F1</siglum> text of <title level="m">WT</title> is not considered word-perfect is evident from the long history of its emendation recorded in this edition’s textual notes; for a contrast of the repairs made by two recent eds., see <ptr targType="div" target="#div_text_printersreliability"/> below.</p>

<p>There is almost no evidence of proofreading.

<head>Subsequent Early Editions</head>

<p>The later history of <title level="m">WT</title> in the 17th c. is told primarily by the entries in the Stationers’ Register, quoted and annotated by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew57"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1957, 3:1113–21). After the publication of <siglum>F1</siglum>, Isaac Jaggard’s widow transferred <quote>her parte in Shackspheere playes</quote> to Thomas and Richard Cotes on 19(?) June 1627, and on 16 Nov. 1630 Edward Blount transferred his right to sixteen plays, including <title level="m">WT</title>, to Robert Allot. The publication of <siglum>F2</siglum> (1632) ensued; the work was printed by Thomas Cotes for Allot and four other stationers. This edition was twice reissued. Because Allot’s widow was about to marry Philip Chetwind—who was a clothworker rather than a stationer—she was forced to give up her copies (on 7 November 1636; the Stationers’ Register entry is dated 1 July 1637). Chetwind recovered the copyrights, however, and became the publisher of the two issues of <siglum>F3</siglum> (1663–4), in the manufacture of which three printers participated. Yet the Stationers’ Company continued to regard the copyrights as the property of Richard Cotes, and on 6 August 1674 transferred them (including the right to <title level="m">WT</title>) to John Martin and Henry Herringman; these rights were again transferred by Martin’s widow to Robert Scott, on 21 August 1683. <siglum>F4</siglum> followed in 1685, its three sections (Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies) evidently having been printed simultaneously by three printers. Textual changes made in <title level="m">WT</title> in the three derivative folios and in the principal later versions may be found in the notes of this edition. None of these changes has independent textual authority.</p>

Thus, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cha1799"><name type="app">Chalmers</name></ref> concludes, <title level="m">WT</title> was written in 1601. Also rejecting <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_blaw1723"><name type="app">Blackstone</name></ref> and his use of the execution of the Queen of Scots as evidence, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dou1807"><name type="app">Douce</name></ref> (1807, 1:347) notes: <quote>The perpetrator of that atrocious murder <hi rend="italic">did flourish</hi> many years afterwards.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dou1807"><name type="app">Douce</name></ref> therefore thinks the allusion in lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_460" targetEnd="#tln_464">460–4</ref> is to King James’s escape from the Gowrie conspiracy (1582), <quote>an event often brought toi the people’s recollection during his reign.</quote></p>

<p>Opposition to such fanciful guessing was bound to arise. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1821"><name type="app">Boswell</name></ref> (ed. 1821, 14:234–5), for example: <quote>I confess I am very sceptical as to these supposed allusions by [<hi rend="italic">235</hi>] Shakspeare to the history of his own time. If the plots of his plays had been of his own invention, he might possibly have framed them with a view of that kind; but this was unquestionably not the case with the play before us; and if any one had intended a courtly defence of Queen Elizabeth’s mother, it must have been Greene, and not Shakspeare. Garinter, the Mamillius of our poet, dies under the same circumstances, in the novel [see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0006"/>]; nor is it, as Mr. Walpole seemed to suppose, an unnecessary incident, because it fulfils the declaration of the oracle, <quote>that if the child which was lost could not be found, the king would die without an heir</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1315" targetEnd="#tln_1316">1315–16</ref>]. To say that a child resembles her father is surely not so uncommon a remark as to make it evident that it had reference to a particular individual; nor is there any thing very courtly or complimentary in Paulina’s angry allusion to the old proverb.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0001">Moreover, <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> had already found the clue needed to begin working through the early speculations, although he did not immediately recognize its value. In his <quote>Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the English Stage</quote> (ed. 1790, 1.2:1–284), <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> first makes use of a document that has since disappeared, the office book of Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels to King James. As <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 2:347) explains, the <quote><hi rend="italic">Office Book</hi> of Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels,&hellip;is now lost, but in 1790 was in the house of Francis Ingram at Ribbesford, Worcestershire, which had belonged to Herbert.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (1.2:226) quotes Herbert’s memorandum: <quote>For the king’s players. An olde playe called <title level="m">Winters Tale</title>, formerly allowed of by Sir George Bucke, and likewyse by mee on Mr. Hemmings his worde that there was nothing prophane added or reformed, thogh the allowed booke was missinge; and therefore I returned itt without a fee, this 19 of August, 1623.</quote> <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> in this context is probably the technical term for the prompt copy of the play on which the license to act was inscribed (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew31a"><name type="app">Greg</name>, 1931, 1:192–3</ref>), although <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pol20"><name type="app">Pollard</name></ref> (1920, p. 67) had thought that the term <quote>possibly [referred to] the original manuscript.</quote> Bucke, or Buc, was Master of the Revels from 1610 to 1622; Hemmings, or Heminge, was an actor with, and the business manager of, the King’s Men.</p>

<p>George Buc had served as deputy Master from 1603, however, and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cha1799"><name type="app">Chalmers</name></ref> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cha1799">(1799, pp. 200 ff.)</ref> prints extracts from the Stationers’ Registers showing Buc as licenser for the printing of plays as early as 1606. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> may or may not be right that Buc did not license plays for performance before he became Master (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_eccm33"><name type="app">Eccles</name></ref>, 1933, p. 458). Thus critics like <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_rol1879"><name type="app">Rolfe</name></ref> (ed. 1879, p. 10 n.), who asserts that <quote>the <title level="m">Stationers’ Registers</title> show&hellip;that he [Buc] had practically the control of the office from the year 1607,</quote> are saying more than the entries in the Registers prove. The same applies to critics like <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wic73"><name type="app">Wickham</name></ref> (1973, p. 96 n.); they maintain that until his official installation as Master, Buc licensed for printing only. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alb27"><name type="app">Albright</name></ref> (1927, p. 246), incidentally, asserts that <title level="m">WT</title> was relicensed to prevent its being <quote>taken over by another company because it was in print,</quote> but <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew28"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1928, p. 96) points out the obvious—that Buc acted not for <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alb27"><name type="app">Albright</name></ref>’s reason <quote>but because the authorised copy had been lost.</quote> That copy was apparently on hand when the play was acted at court on 7 April 1618 and perhaps in 1619 as well (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0007"/>); as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt65"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (<title level="m">Division</title>, 1965, p. 51) notes, its absence may have been discovered when the company began to prepare for the court performance of 18 January 1624 (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0007"/>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew54"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1954, p. 150): <quote><title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> is peculiar in that it may have been a late addition to the folio, and that a new prompt-book was licensed by Herbert in August 1623.&hellip;These facts are probably related, but it is not clear that they have any bearing on the nature of the text.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dra1817"><name type="app">Drake</name></ref> (1817, 1:504–5), convinced that <title level="m">Tmp.</title> <quote>was written towards the close of 1611,</quote> argues (1:497) that <title level="m">WT</title> was written <quote>towards the close of 1610</quote> and was <quote><hi rend="italic">licensed</hi> and <hi rend="italic">performed</hi> during the succeeding year.</quote> The order of the two plays is assumed to be that in which they were named by Jonson.

As <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_colj1836"><name type="app">Collier</name></ref>’s forgeries and impostures were revealed, Forman’s Book of Plays also fell under suspicion, but W. H.

Further authentication became available with the publication by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cunp1842"><name type="app">Cunningham</name></ref> (1842) of extracts from the Revels Accounts, in which the performance of <title level="m">WT</title> on 5 November 1611, mentioned above, is recorded. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_col1"><name type="app">Collier</name></ref> (ed. 1842, 3:425–6), however: <quote><title level="m" rend="quotes">The Tempest</title> and <title level="m" rend="quotes">The Winter’s Tale</title> were both acted at Whitehall, and included in Sir George Buc’s account of the expenses of the Revels from October, 1611, to October, 1612.

According to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_org87"><name type="app">Orgel</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, 1987, pp. 63–4), <quote>There is&hellip;not&hellip;any way of determining chronological priority between <title level="m">The Tempest</title> and <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">64</hi>] The most we can say is that the evidence supports a date of late 1610 to mid-1611 [for <title level="m">Tmp.</title>], and that Shakespeare was writing the play just after, or just before, or at the same time as <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_hal"><name type="app">Halliwell</name></ref> (ed. 1859, 8:44): <quote>With equal probability, it might be conjectured that Shakespeare, having omitted the incident in the construction of the Winter’s Tale, introduced it in the Tempest as one especially suited to a romantic drama of that description.</quote></p>

<p>Another approach is represented by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pro1844"><name type="app">Procter</name></ref> (1844, 1:x–xi), who finds <title level="m">WT</title> too badly written to be a late play: <quote>As a general principle,&hellip;I would say, that the plays in which signs of imitation (particularly imitation of style) are manifest, should be accounted the earliest; and that those wherein the poetry is redundant and far exceeds the necessities and purposes of the story, should be held to have preceded, in point of time, the great and substantial dramas, in which the business of the play is skilfully wrought out, and where the poetry springs out of the passion or humour of the characters, and serves to illustrate and not to oppress them. In conformity with this view, I think that the [<hi rend="italic">xi</hi>] <title level="m" rend="quotes smcaps">Winter’s Tale</title>, although perhaps not actually performed until the year 1611, can never have been the last work of Shakspere. It is far more like the labour of his youth,</quote> an idea to be revived seventy-five years later on supposedly scientific as well as impressionistic evidence (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0008"/>). Nevertheless, by the time of <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_hud1"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (ed. 1852, 4:6), the composition of <title level="m">WT</title> was assigned to <quote>the winter of 1610–11.</quote> The later limit is 15 May 1611, when Forman saw the play. <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0023-a"/>The earlier limit, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thoa00"><name type="app">Thorndike</name></ref> (1900, pp. 116–17) argues, was shortly after 1 January 1611, the date of the performance at court of Ben Jonson’s <title level="m">Oberon</title>, the action of which opens upon Silenus, a shaggy old forest god, and at least five of the satyrs over whom he presides (the number who speak). For the probable reappearance of three of these satyrs in <title level="m">WT</title>, see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2059">2164</ref> and <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0007-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0007-b"/>. The <quote>shortly</quote> arises from the assumption that the three saltiers who danced before the king (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2158" targetEnd="#tln_2159">2158–9</ref>) must have done so recently in order for the audience, or at least the members of it who knew about courtly amusements, to grasp the allusion and perhaps also in order for the men still to be available to perform in <title level="m">WT</title>. Yet the line is spoken in modern performances, its significance having become that the three will unknowingly dance before the king once more—that is, King Polixenes. It possibly never meant more than this. Moreover, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nica58"><name type="app">Nicoll</name></ref> suggests (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2059">2164</ref>), the satyr dance could be an interpolation.<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0023-b"/> <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0005-a"/>Thus <title level="m">WT</title> may have no precise anterior limit, but, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel87"><name type="app">Wells</name> &amp; <name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (1987, p. 601) point out, if the Crane transcript from which the <siglum>F</siglum> text was typeset derived from the promptbook, <quote>the original composition predates January 1611</quote> (see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0006-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0006-b"/>).<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0005-b"/></p>

The datum point was the legend of the division of Britain by King Brutus among his three sons and Merlin’s prophecy of eventual reunion under a descendant of King Arthur.

<p>Apart from <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_eve70"><name type="app">Everett</name></ref>, however, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wic69a"><name type="app">Wickham</name></ref>’s topicality seems to have attracted no supporters.

The trouble is that Mary’s statue was not finished until 1612&hellip;and by this time <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> had been on the stage for two years.

<head>Internal Evidence</head>

<p>As <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1898"><name type="app">Furness</name></ref> (ed. 1898, p. 316) says, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rod1758"><name type="app">Roderick</name></ref> (1758, p. 225) was apparently the first to observe that the verse lines of <title level="m">H8</title> more frequently than those of other plays <quote>end in a redundant syllable.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_male1741"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1778"><name type="app">Steevens</name></ref>, ed. 1778, 1:280 n.) adds that a mixture of rhyming lines and blank verse is <quote>a circumstance which seems to characterize and distinguish our poet’s earliest performance.</quote> From these beginnings developed a close study of Sh.’s style to determine, more exactly than external evidence allows, when he wrote his works.</p>

<p>The earliest critic to divide Sh.’s career into four periods distinguished by stylistic differences was <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_batc1857"><name type="app">Bathurst</name></ref> (1857). By the third quarter of the 19th c., one of the internal tests of chronology given by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wara1899"><name type="app">Ward</name></ref> (1875, 1:359–63) was versification, subdivided as follows: (a) Rhyme: <quote>Progress from more to less rhyme may be held to accompany the general progress of Shakspere as a dramatic writer.</quote> (b) Stopped and unstopped lines: <quote>A <quote>stopped</quote> line is one in which the sentence, or clause of the sentence, concludes with the line; but it is not always possible to determine what is to be regarded as the clause of the sentence, whether <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> <hi rend="italic">and</hi> is to be regarded&hellip;as beginning a new clause. The stopping of the sense is&hellip;often of more importance than the <quote>stopping</quote> of the sentence.</quote> (c) Feminine endings, or line endings with an eleventh, unaccented, syllable: <quote>While it is certain that Shakspere employed the feminine endings sparingly in many of his plays&hellip;regarded as early, it is certain that in those plays which on other grounds may be regarded as&hellip;late&hellip;he employed these endings largely.</quote> Ward’s examples, supplied by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1874"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref>, include <rs type="sh" key="Shr."><title level="m">Shr.</title> (now dated 1593–4), line 260</rs>, and <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_639">639</ref>, but also <rs type="sh" key="R3"><title level="m">R3</title> (1592–3), line 570</rs>. The tabulations are not adjusted for the length of the plays or the proportions in them of verse and prose. And (d) Other verse tests, such as irregularities in the trimeter couplets of the early plays and, in the late plays, such carelessness as the failure to mark the caesura.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1874"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref> himself (1876) divides Sh.’s career into periods characterized by more or less distinct metrical features. In the last period (pp. 70–1), doggerel, alternately rhyming lines, and couplets are absent; alexandrines, with considerable variation in the position of the caesura, increase; and so do feminine endings; and so do <quote>lines of less than five measures.</quote> Fleay assigns <title level="m">WT</title> (p. 136), along with <title level="m">Cym.</title>, <title level="m">Cor.</title>, <title level="m">Ant.</title>, and <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, to Sh.’s fourth (and last) period, but in a postscript (p. 138) creates a fifth period for <title level="m">Tmp.</title> and <title level="m">WT</title> alone. The actual date he assigns to <title level="m">WT</title> is 1610–11 (p. 54) or 1611 (p. 130), 1611? having earlier been proposed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fur1874"><name type="app">Furnivall</name></ref> (1874, p. xlv). Later, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1886"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref> (1886, p. 65) decides that <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>was certainly produced early this year [1610], before Jonson’s <title level="m">Alchemist</title>, which was acted and entered S[tationers’] R[egister] October 3.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1886"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref>’s techniques and conclusions raised questions immediately (see the discussion following the reading of his paper before the New Shakspere Society on 13 Mar. 1874, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1874"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref>, 1874), and he changed his mind as his investigations continued. In any event, his date for <title level="m">WT</title> was not affected; in the 1886 work (p. 247) as in the 1874 volume (p. 10), it is 1610. By introducing this type of analysis, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1874"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref> hoped to apply a scientific technique to the problems of Shn. chronology, but his followers proved capable of wild variations in method and conclusions, and he himself could not count.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0008">The predilection for Shn. statistics, however, extends to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bath1887"><name type="app">Bather</name></ref>’s <quote>Table of Plays, According to Number of Puns</quote> (1887, p. 74), which shows a decrease in the number of puns per 100 lines from 3.97 in <title level="m">LLL</title> to 0.26 in <title level="m">WT</title>. As a technique for dating, the scheme is demolished by the fact that <title level="m">Tit.</title> contains only 0.15 and <title level="m">3H6</title> only 0.14. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bay20"><name type="app">Bayfield</name></ref>’s (1920, pp. 402–3) verse analysis reveals that <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>must have been written some years before the generally received date 1610.&hellip;It suggests that the performance at the Globe theatre on May 15, 1611&hellip;must refer to a revival.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">403</hi>] [<title level="m">WT</title>’s] versification is in fact of a quite different period [from that of the late plays. <title level="m">WT</title> was written] near <title level="m">Troilus and Cressida</title>, <title level="m">The Taming of the Shrew</title>, and <title level="m">Timon</title>.</quote> On the other hand, impressionistic critics who did not conduct verse tests could also reach strange conclusions. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spenj22"><name type="app">Spens</name></ref> (1922, p. 92), for example, <quote>suspects that all the Romances&hellip;were written originally by Shakespeare at the very beginning of his career, and that they were for the most part one or two act pieces forming part of a series.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_matf22"><name type="app">Mathew</name></ref> (1922, p. 41) agrees in part: <quote>These Plays were written first when Shakespeare was young and revised when he was mature.</quote></p>

<p>The testimony of internal evidence is usually linked to the historical and practical facts of Sh.’s career, the latter being, for instance, that Sh. could not write more than a certain amount in a certain period, about two plays a year when his known work is distributed over the period during which he is believed to have been active. The distribution may also be colored by assumptions, not necessarily wrong, about Sh.’s development as a man and an artist. As <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1877"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> (1877, pp. 37–41) puts it, <quote>We need no scientific test to make us aware that, in passing from <title level="m">Love’s Labour’s Lost</title> to <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, and from <title level="m">Hamlet</title> to <title level="m">The Tempest</title>, we pass from youth to manhood, and again from a manhood of trial and sorrow to a riper manhood of attainment and of calm.</quote> Affected by the transitions are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) style and diction. <quote>In the earliest plays&hellip;the idea is at times hardly sufficient to fill out the language in which it is put; in the middle plays&hellip;there seems a perfect balance and equality between the thought and its expression[; in the latest] this balance is disturbed by the preponderance or excess of the ideas over the means of giving them utterance.&hellip; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The growth of Shakspere’s taste and judgment.&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">38</hi>] (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) In the structure of the play and grouping of characters there is, in some of the early plays, a tendency to formal symmetry, an artificial setting of character over against character, and group against group.&hellip;Afterwards the outline of the play is drawn with a freer because a firmer hand. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)&hellip;By degrees the characterisation becomes profound and refined.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The entire reflective power deepens.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The imagination&hellip;becomes passionately energetic, of daring and all-comprehensive power, as in <title level="m">King Lear</title>, or lofty and sustained, with noble ideality, as in <title level="m">The Tempest</title>. (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) The sympathy with human passion and the power of conceiving and dramatically rendering it in its most massive and most intense [<hi rend="italic">39</hi>] forms increases. (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>)&hellip;The humour of the dramatist&hellip;becomes full of grave significance, and works in conjunction with his (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) Deepening pathos.&hellip;(<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) Finally, in moral reach, in true justice, in charity, in self-control, in all that indicate fortitude of will, the writings of the mature Shakspere excel, in an extraordinary degree, those of his younger self.</quote> These characteristics obviously cannot be quantified, but the alteration in Sh.’s verse can be. <quote>At first Shakspere has his breaks and pauses at the end of the line—the verse is <quote>end-stopt</quote>; gradually he more and more [carries] on the sense from one line to another without a pause at the end of the line [but] in some part of the line other than the end.</quote> Light and weak endings increase. The first group, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1877"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref>’s classification, encompasses words on which (p. 41) <quote>the voice can to a small extent dwell</quote> (<hi rend="italic">am, are, be, can, could;</hi> the auxiliaries <hi rend="italic">do, does, has, had; I, they, thou</hi>). The weak endings are <quote>more fugitive and evanescent&hellip;, including such words as <hi rend="italic">and, for, from, if, in, of, or</hi>. Now weak endings hardly appear in Shakspere’s early or middle plays.&hellip;Nor do they come in by slow degrees at a later period.&hellip;In <title level="m">Macbeth</title> light endings appear for the first time in considerable numbers; weak endings in considerable numbers for the first time in <title level="m">Antony and Cleopatra</title>. This test serves perfectly to pick out the plays which form the group belonging to Shakspere’s last period of dramatic authorship; and within that period it probably serves to indicate nearly the precise order in which the plays were written.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1877"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> reproduces part of a table devised by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ingj1874"><name type="app">Ingram</name></ref> (1874, p. 450) showing percentages of light and weak endings, from <title level="m">Mac.</title> through <title level="m">H8</title>, in a sequence that does not quite bear <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1877"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> out, in that it places <title level="m">Tmp.</title> earlier than <title level="m">Cym.</title> and <title level="m">WT</title>. Similarly, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1877"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> reproduces a table he attributes to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_herw1878"><name type="app">Hertzberg</name></ref>; it shows the percentage of double, or feminine, endings increasing from <title level="m">LLL</title> (4) through <title level="m">Tmp.</title> and puts <title level="m">WT</title> (31.09) before <title level="m">Cym.</title> (32) by a whisker. Actually, the table <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_herw1878"><name type="app">Hertzberg</name></ref> published (1878, p. 252) reverses the sequence (<title level="m">WT</title> 32.5), but in neither accounting is the difference great enough to establish priority. (Similar data from which similar conclusions were drawn persisted; see, for example, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nei13"><name type="app">Neilson</name> &amp; <name type="app">Thorndike</name></ref>, c. 1913, pp. 69–75.)</p>

<p>The history of stylistic analysis and the efforts of other contributors to it are described in detail by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:242–74). As a prelude to his own assignment of dates, he provides a thorough discussion of the problem of chronology, an evaluation of the evidence of dates, and (in 2:397–408) his own metrical tables, several of them corrected versions of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fle1874"><name type="app">Fleay</name></ref>’s. He believes (1:489) that <quote>the style and metre group <title level="m">Winter’s Tale</title> with <title level="m">Cymbeline</title> and <title level="m">Tempest</title>, and it may reasonably be placed between them. A date early in 1611 is suggested by the probability that the bear of iii.3 and the dance of satyrs at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2164">2164</ref>] were both inspired by Jonson’s mask of <title level="m">Oberon</title> on 1 January 1611.</quote> For the bear, see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1436">1500</ref>, and for the satyrs, n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2059">2164</ref>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gray31"><name type="app">Gray</name></ref> (1931, p. 148) averages <quote>the percentages of double [i.e., feminine] endings, run-on lines, and speeches ending with the line</quote> and discovers that the results for <title level="m">WT</title>, <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, and <title level="m">Cym.</title>, though close to those for <title level="m">Cor.</title> on the earlier side and <title level="m">H8</title> on the later, are also close to each other. Having related independent clauses to verse lines, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lanc31"><name type="app">Langworthy</name></ref> (1931, p. 748) gets similar results for the same plays, although his data order them as <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, <title level="m">Cym.</title>, and <title level="m">WT</title>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_law36"><name type="app">Law</name></ref> (1936, pp. 50–1) tabulates the dates assigned by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adaj23"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1923), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ald25"><name type="app">Alden</name></ref> (1925), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930), <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_cra1931"><name type="app">Craig</name></ref> (ed. 1931), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_camo32"><name type="app">Campbell</name></ref> (1932), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_part34"><name type="app">Parrott</name></ref> (1934), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_bro1935"><name type="app">Brooke</name></ref> (ed. 1935).

So does <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_reih42"><name type="app">Reinhold</name></ref> (1942, p. 87); like <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ora60"><name type="app">Oras</name></ref> (see below), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_reih42"><name type="app">Reinhold</name></ref> calculates split lines (pentameters shared by two or more speakers) as a percentage of the total lines in each play to show that their number generally increases with time. In an early statistical study, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_yar46"><name type="app">Yardi</name></ref> (1946) uses multiple measurements of metrical data for the discrimination of groups; the results place <title level="m">WT</title> with <title level="m">Cym.</title> and <title level="m">Tmp.</title> but do not provide actual dates. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_brab80"><name type="app">Brainerd</name></ref>’s (1980) statistical study of Shn. chronology has no bearing, for <title level="m">WT</title>, dated 1610.5, is a member of the test set, plays for the most part unambiguously dated.</p>

<p>A few recent critics dissent. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wenk51"><name type="app">Wentersdorf</name></ref> (1951, p. 178), combining such stylistic features as split lines, extra syllables within and at the end of lines, feminine endings, and alexandrines into a metrical index for each play, finds the three last to have been written in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>’s (1930) order, but he moves each work back by a year, <title level="m">WT</title> to 1609–10. As <title level="m">Tmp.</title> was performed at court on 1 November 1611, it would have been acted publicly <quote>at least by the summer of 1611,</quote> since public success presumably preceded the selection of any play for presentation at court. If the dance of satyrs in <title level="m">WT</title> derives from Jonson’s <title level="m">Oberon</title>, <title level="m">WT</title> may nevertheless have been in existence prior to January 1611, when the masque was performed, and the satyrs subsequently added. <quote>It has also been suggested that the bear scene in Act iii was borrowed from&hellip;<title level="m" rend="quotes">Mucedorus</title>, which was revived by the King’s Men shortly before 1610. If this was the case (as the bear episode is not in Shakespeare’s source for <title level="m">WT</title>), it points to an upward [i.e., anterior] time limit late in 1609.&hellip;Finally, the reference at [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_461">461</ref>] is sufficiently motivated by the story and in any case too general to warrant interpretation to the murder of Henri IV on 14 May 1610</quote> (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>, 1930, 2:489). Having assigned <title level="m">Per.</title> to 1607–8 and <title level="m">Tmp.</title> to 1610–11, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mut50"><name type="app">Wentersdorf</name></ref> accordingly dates <title level="m">Cym.</title> and <title level="m">WT</title> 1608–9 and 1609–10, respectively. Also dissenting is <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ora60"><name type="app">Oras</name></ref> (1960), who studies three types of pauses in the verse of Sh. and a number of other early writers, under three heads: all pauses indicated by the internal punctuation of the earliest eds. (A-patterns); strong pauses indicated by punctuation heavier than commas (B-patterns); and lines shared by two or more speakers—split lines—(C-patterns). That the punctuation may be scribal or compositorial is recognized, but it is still considered a valid marker because its source is contemporaneous. The data are presented numerically and graphically, and although no actual dates are assigned, the patterns of <title level="m">Cym.</title> and <title level="m">WT</title> resemble each other more strongly than they resemble the patterns of the other works studied.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0067"><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_alex"><name type="app">Alexander</name></ref> (ed. 1951, p. xv), wisely declining to be pinned down to more than <quote>an approximate order of composition,</quote> places <title level="m">WT</title>, along with <title level="m">Per.</title>, <title level="m">Cym.</title>, <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, and <title level="m">H8</title>, between 1608 and 1613. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_max60"><name type="app">Maxwell</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">Cym.</title>, 1960, p. xi), commenting on 1609–10 and 1610–11 for the dates of <title level="m">Cym.</title> and <title level="m">WT</title>, respectively: <quote>It is reasonable to associate the greater artistic assurance of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> with a later date [than <title level="m">Cym.</title>’s], which is also supported by the fact that Shakespeare undoubtedly knew the Boccaccio source of <title level="m">Cymbeline</title> when he wrote <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>. I think [the 1610–11] date for <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> may well be a year too late. There is a fairly close verbal parallel between <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1941" targetEnd="#tln_1947">1941–7</ref>] and <title level="m">Philaster</title> [4.6.2–8], which seems to me most easily explained as an echo of the former by the latter; and <title level="m">Philaster</title> is not later than 8 October 1610 [see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae23"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>, 1923, 3:223].</quote> To <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tile62b"><name type="app">Tillyard</name></ref> (1938, pp. 9–10), however, the echoes seem reversed: Sh. is improving Fletcher (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1865">1941–7</ref>). In any case, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> (ed. 1963, p. 97 n.) remarks, the strewing of corpses as well as bridal beds with flowers is a common idea.</p>

<p>As for the presence of <title level="m">Cym.</title>’s source in <title level="m">WT</title>, the story in question is the ninth novel of the second day of Boccaccio’s <title level="m">Decameron</title>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mui57"><name type="app">Muir</name></ref> (1977, pp. 262–3) summarizes it: <quote>Some Italian merchants at an inn in Paris deride the idea of a female chastity and Bernabo of Genoa is provoked by Ambrogiuolo to bet on the chastity of his wife, Ginevra. On going to Genoa, Ambrogiuolo realizes that he cannot seduce Ginevra. Concealed in a chest, he is able to observe the pictures of her bedroom, to steal a ring and other belongings, and to observe a mole on the lady’s breast. Bernabo is convinced that he has lost the wager and he orders his servant to murder Ginevra. The servant, convinced of her innocence, spares her. She dresses in his clothes and takes service with the Soldan. One day she sees her purse and girdle in a stall in the market-place. When the truth comes to light, Ginevra reveals herself to her husband and forgives him. The villain is tortured to death:

<quote rend="block">the verie same day that hee was impaled on the stake, annointed with honey, and fixed in the place appointed, to his no meane tormente: he not onely died, but likewise was deuoured to the bare [<hi rend="italic">263</hi>] bones, by Flies, Waspes, and Hornets, whereof the Countrey notoriously aboundeth.</quote>

As Iachimo is forgiven, this torture is not used in <title level="m">Cymbeline</title>; but in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> Autolycus tells the Clown [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2665" targetEnd="#tln_2672">2665–72</ref>].</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_smih72"><name type="app">Smith</name></ref> (1972, p. 216) holds that <quote>it is generally agreed&hellip;that <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> is the later of the two [because] the use of the leftover passage about the punishment of the villain&hellip;suggests that <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> followed <title level="m">Cymbeline</title>.</quote></p>

<p>Earlier, however, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nos55"><name type="app">Nosworthy</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">Cym.</title>, 1955, pp. xvi–xvii), instead of drawing this conclusion, recognizes <quote>the possibility that Shakespeare owed the name <quote>Belarius</quote> [in <title level="m">Cym.</title>] to the Bellaria of Greene’s <title level="m">Pandosto</title>&hellip;so that the evidence can point either way. My own guess is that the composition of the two plays was more or less simultaneous or, at any rate, that both had been written, revised and prepared for the stage before either was actually performed, with consequent cross-fertilisation. This view&hellip;tallies with the attractive theory, put forward by [<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ben48"><name type="app">Bentley</name></ref>, 1948], that the impending acquisition of the Blackfriars private theatre led, in the Spring and Summer of 1608, to discussions among the King’s Players as a result of which Shakespeare was henceforth to write with the Blackfriars in mind, and not the Globe, and that [<title level="m">Cym.</title>, <title level="m">WT</title>, and <title level="m">Tmp.</title>,] in that [<hi rend="italic">xvii</hi>] order, were the fruits of that decision. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ben48"><name type="app">Bentley</name></ref> says nothing about their respective dates, but the application of his theory would&hellip;suggest 1608 for the first play of the series.</quote> Recalling that it was at the public theater that Forman saw <title level="m">WT</title>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nos55"><name type="app">Nosworthy</name></ref> demurs at <quote>and not the Globe,</quote> preferring to think that after his company acquired the Blackfriars theater in 1608, Sh. wrote dual-purpose plays, <quote>for such, most emphatically and triumphantly, the Romances are.</quote> If <title level="m">Cym.</title>, the first play of the series, was composed in 1608, 1608–9 would presumably be the date of <title level="m">WT</title>. Although <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> (ed. 1963, p. xxiii) does not deal explicitly with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nos55"><name type="app">Nosworthy</name></ref>’s idea, he comments: <quote>The language, style, and spirit of the play all point to a late date. The tangled speech, the packed sentences, speeches which begin and end in the middle of a line, and the high percentage of light and weak endings are all marks of Shakespeare’s writing at the end of his career. But of more importance than verse tests is the similarity of the last plays in spirit and themes.&hellip;Practically all authorities&hellip;accept, with minor variations, the approximate dates given by Chambers [i.e., 1610–11].</quote> Those who do not follow <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae23"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> may instead favor <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mut50"><name type="app">Wentersdorf</name></ref>—for example, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fit81"><name type="app">Fitch</name></ref> (1981, p. 300), who, in a revival of sense-pause investigation, decides on 1609–10.</p>

<head>Summary</head>

<p>A comprehensive reexamination of the internal evidence of <title level="m">WT</title>’s date is made by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg87"><name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel87"><name type="app">Wells</name> &amp; <name type="app">Taylor</name></ref>, pp. 93–109). Among the data included are the percentage of rhyme to verse and to prose; colloquialisms in verse (e.g., <hi rend="italic">i’th’</hi>, <hi rend="italic">’em</hi>, <hi rend="italic">’ll</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I’m</hi>), which show <quote>that Shakespeare’s reversion to an antiquated dramatic form [the romance] apparently coincides with some backsliding toward a less colloquial poetry</quote> (p. 101); and a revision of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mut50"><name type="app">Wentersdorf</name></ref>’s metrical indices and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ora60"><name type="app">Oras</name></ref>’s pause patterns. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel87"><name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> concludes (p. 107) that <quote>although minor ambiguities remain about the order of particular plays, we can be reasonably confident about the shape of the canon after about 1597.</quote> Nevertheless, recent eds. differ to some extent, as the following comparison shows (see <ref targType="table" target="#table_app_004">table</ref>).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930) is included because his chronology was accepted by many eds. until recently; all his dates given here are reiterated by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mcm50"><name type="app">McManaway</name></ref> (1950). <title level="m">Lr.</title> is present because <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg87"><name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> holds that the text of that play included in <siglum>F1</siglum> is a revision of the text that first appeared in the quarto of 1608 substantial enough to constitute a new creation. <title level="m">Cardenio</title> is a play based on a story in <title level="m">Don Quixote</title> and thought to be by Shakespeare and Fletcher (as are <title level="m">H8</title> and <title level="m">TNK</title>). As <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:539) notes: <quote>A play of <title level="m">Cardenno</title> or <title level="m">Cardenna</title> was given by the King’s men at court in the winter of 1612–13.</quote> It was acted in 1727 under the title <title level="m">Double Falsehood</title> and printed in 1728 as <quote>Written Originally by W. Shakespeare; And now Revised and Adapted to the Stage by Mr. Theobald.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_bev1992"><name type="app">Bevington</name></ref>’s <title level="m">WT</title> range is an innovation for him; his previous editions of the <title level="m">Works</title> (1973 and 1980) substantially agree with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> and with <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_evns"><name type="app">Evans</name></ref> (c. 1610–11). He appears to have extended these dates on the chance that <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tayg87"><name type="app">Taylor</name></ref> may be right, a question that critics of <title level="m">Lr.</title> will have to decide. As it now stands, however, c. 1610–11 is as close as one can come to the date of <title level="m">WT</title>.</p>

<p>The first ed. of <title level="m">WT</title> to quote extensively from <title level="m">Pandosto</title> to illustrate Sh.’s dependence was <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_mal"><name type="app">Malone</name></ref> (ed. 1790).

Farmer reported a copy of <title level="m">Pandosto</title> with a publication date of 1588, considerably before any date proposed for Sh.’s play.</p>

<p>On 1 July 1588, <quote>A booke intitled <title level="m">the complaint of tyme</title></quote> was entered in the Register of the Company of Stationers to Thomas Orwin (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_arb1875"><name type="app">Arber</name></ref>, 1875–94, 2:493). <title level="m">Pandosto. The Triumph of Time</title> was printed by Orwin for the stationer Thomas Cadman (<title level="m">RSTC</title> [3:277] 12285); <title level="m">The Historie of Dorastus and Fawnia</title> is its head title. The discrepancy between the title as given in the Register and the title as published creates some uncertainty that the entry pertains to the novel (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel88"><name type="app">Wells</name>, 1988, pp. xxx–xxxi</ref>); even so, there is no reason to doubt that the novel appeared in 1588. It was frequently reprinted—in 1592, 1595, 1600 (<title level="m">RSTC</title> 12287.5, a single copy in the Biblioteka Gdanska), 1607, 1609, 1614, 1619, 1621 (a single copy in the Vienna National Library, located by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel88"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>; not in <title level="m">RSTC</title>), 1629, 1632, 1632–6 (date cropped; see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel88"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>, p. xxxviii), 1636, and c. 1640 (date cropped; see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alla75"><name type="app">Allison</name></ref>, 1975, no. 84). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel88"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (pp. xl–xlii) identifies eleven more editions of <title level="m">Pandosto</title>, including an abridgment, published from 1648 to the end of the century and seven or eight more complete eds. and abridgments from about 1700 to 1735; uncertainties in the tabulation arise from difficulties in distinguishing the eds. and in dating them. The title pages of eds. 1588 through 1632 carry as a subtitle <title level="m">The Triumph of Time</title>; in eds. 1636 and following, the earlier title and subtitle are replaced by <title level="m">The Pleasant Historie of Dorastus and Fawnia</title>, the title <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lang1691"><name type="app">Langbaine</name></ref> was thinking of.</p>

The actual situation, according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel88"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1988, p. 128), is that the eds. of 1588, 1592, and 1595 read <quote>liue,</quote> as Sh. does (<title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1315">1315</ref>), whereas 1609 and subsequent eds. read <quote>die.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mui57"><name type="app">Muir</name></ref> (1957, p. 240) asserts that Sh. used the 1588 ed., but, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel88"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> remarks, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mui57"><name type="app">Muir</name></ref> evidently did not know that the 1592 and 1595 eds. existed.

<p>According to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bol1891b"><name type="app">Bolte</name></ref> (<title level="a">Schlussscene,</title> 1891, p. 90), the novel provided material for a French play and a Dutch play: Jean Puget de La Serre’s <title level="m">Pandoste ou la Princesse malheureuse, en deux journées</title> (Paris, 1631), which was performed at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1631; and Meynert Voskuyl’s <title level="m">Dorastus en Fauniaas</title> (Amsterdam, 1637). The <title level="m">British Library Catalogue</title> also lists Voskuyl’s <title level="m">Bellaria en Pandostos</title> (Amstrelredam, 1637). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thop07"><name type="app">Thomas</name></ref> (1907, p. xix) reports that a French version by Alexandre Hardy, who wrote several pastoral plays, is now lost. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jus07b"><name type="app">Jusserand</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jus07b"><name type="app">Lee</name></ref>, ed. 1907, pp. xxviii–xxix) gives further details: <quote>The first translation was printed at Paris, <quote>chez Guillaume Marette</quote>, in 1615, under the title of <title level="a">Histoire tragique de Pandosto roy de Bohême et de Bellaria sa femme. Ensemble les amours de Dorastus et de Faunia.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">xxix</hi>] Le tout traduit premièrement en Anglois de la langue Bohême, et de nouveau mis en françois par L. Regnault</title>.&hellip; The translation [takes] a good many liberties&hellip;with the text (some voluntary, others not).&hellip; To the supposed <quote>Bohemian</quote> original there is no further allusion.</quote> One adaptation, <title level="m">Le roman d’Albanie et de Sycile par le S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> du Bail gentil-homme Poict[evin]</title>, appeared in 1626, and another, <title level="m">Histoire de Pandolphe, roy de Bohême et de Cellaria sa femme</title>, in 1722. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jus1890"><name type="app">Jusserand</name></ref> also supplies (pp. xxxvi–xxxix) <quote>the sketches made by the stage decorator [<hi rend="italic">xxxvii</hi>] Mahelot for the scenery used in the performance</quote> of Hardy’s dramatic version.</p>

 <p>A derivative in blank verse, Francis Sabie’s <title level="m">The Fissher-mans Tale</title> (<title level="m">RSTC</title> 21535), appeared in 1595, some copies being issued as a part of Sabie’s <title level="m">Pans Pipe</title>, three eclogues in hexameters; and <title level="m">The Fissher-mans Tale</title> was followed by a second part, <title level="m">Flora’s Fortune</title> (<title level="m">RSTC</title> 21536), also in 1595. These poems were reprinted by <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_hal"><name type="app">Halliwell</name></ref> (ed. 1859, 8:127–60)—possibly from a defective copy, since the <quote>extracts,</quote> as he calls his text, run from line 632 of <title level="m">The Fissher-mans Tale</title> to the end of <title level="m">Flora’s Fortune</title>.</p>

<p><title level="m">Pandosto</title> of 1588 collates A–G<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>. The one surviving copy, located in the British Library, lacks the four leaves of sig. B; the missing text is supplied here by the edition of 1592, Folger Shakespeare Library. In the following reprint, the black letter of these eds. is rendered as roman and the roman as italic. <quote>The Epitaph</quote> (<ptr targType="lg" target="#lg_pan_epitaph"/>) is italic in ed. 1588. Most ornaments are ignored. Macrons and abbreviations of <hi rend="italic">the</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">with</hi> have been expanded. The two- and three-line initials beginning certain paragraphs are reduced to regular capitals, turned letters are returned, and the white space preceding and following some lines of dialogue has been removed. Footnotes show the origin of emendations of the 1588 and 1592 texts; the spelling of the emendations has been altered occasionally to accord with that of the copy-text. Asterisks in the text call attention to the footnotes. In the notes, a wavy dash in the variant reading repeats the word of the lemma in the corresponding position; the caret indicates absence of punctuation.</p>

<p>The Rascians (right honorable) when by long gazing against the Sunne, they become halfe blinde, recouer their sightes by looking on the blacke Loade stone. Vnicornes being glutted with brousing on roots of Licquoris, sharpen their stomacks with crushing bitter grasse.</p>
<p>Alexander vouchsafed as well to smile at the croked picture of Vulcan, as to wonder at the curious counterfeite of Venus. The minde is sometimes delighted as much with small trifles as with sumptuous triumphs, and as wel pleased with hearing of Pans homely fancies, as of Hercules renowmed laboures.</p>
<p>Syllie Baucis could not serue Iupiter in a siluer plate, but in a woodden dish. Al that honour Esculapius, decke not his shrine with Iewels. Apollo giues Oracles as wel to the poore man for his mite, as to the rich man for his treasure.

<p><name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, thy youth warneth me to preuent the worst, and mine age to prouide the best. Oportunities neglected, are signes of folly: actions measured by time, are seldome bitten with repentance: thou art young, and I olde: age hath taught me that, which thy youth cannot yet conceiue.</p>

<p>I therefore will counsell thee as a father, hoping thou wilt obey as a childe. Thou seest my white hayres are blossomes for the graue, and thy freshe colour fruite for time and fortune, so that it behooueth me to thinke how to dye, and for thee to care how to liue. My crowne I must leaue by death, and thou enioy my Kingdome by succession, wherein I hope thy vertue and prowesse shall bee such, as though my subiectes want my person, yet they shall see in thee my perfection. That nothing either may faile to satisfie thy minde, or increase thy dignities: the onely care I haue, is to see thee well marryed before I die, and thou become olde.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> who from his infancy, delighted rather to die with <name rend="italic">Mars</name> in the Fielde, then to dally with <name rend="italic">Venus</name> in the Chamber: fearing to displease his father, and yet not willing to be wed, made him this reuerent answere.</p>

<p>Sir, there is no greater bond than duetie, nor no straiter law then nature: disobedience in youth is often galled with despight in age. The commaund of the father ought to be a constraint to the childe: so parentes willes are laws, so they passe not all lawes: may it please your Grace therefore to appoint whome I shall loue, rather then by deniall I should be appeached of disobedience: I rest content to loue, though it bee the only thing I hate.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Egistus</name> hearing his sonne to flie so farre from the marke, began to be somewhat chollericke, and therefore made him his hasty aunswere.</p>

<p>This wittie answer of <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> so inflamed <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> fancy, as he commended him selfe for making so good a choyce, thinking, [<hi rend="smcaps">tln</hi> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2449" targetEnd="#tln_2453">2449–53</ref>] if her birth were aunswerable to her wit and beauty, that she were a fitte mate for the most famous Prince in the worlde. He therefore beganne to sifte her more narrowely on this manner.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, I see thou art content with Country labours, because thou knowest not Courtly pleasures: I commend thy wit, and pitty thy want: but wilt thou leaue thy Fathers Cottage, and serue a Courtlie Mistresse.</p>

<p>Sir (quoth she) beggers ought not to striue against fortune, nor to gaze after honour, least either their fall be greater, or they become blinde. I am borne to toile for the Court, not in the Court, my nature vnfit for their nurture, better liue then in meane degree, than in high disdaine.</p>

<p>Well saide, <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> (quoth <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>) I gesse at thy thoughtes, thou art in loue with some Countrey Shep-<milestone unit="sig_pan" n="E2" xml:id="pan_sig_E2_88" ed="1588">[E2]</milestone>hearde.</p>

<p>No sir (quoth she) shepheards cannot loue, that are so simple, and maides may not loue that are so young.</p>

<p>Nay therefore (quoth <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>) maides must loue, because they are young, for <name rend="italic">Cupid</name> is a child, and <name rend="italic">Venus</name>, though olde, is painted with fresh coloures.</p>

<p>I graunt (quoth she) age may be painted with new shadowes, and youth may haue imperfect affections: but what arte concealeth in one, ignorance reuealeth in the other. <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> seeing <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> helde him so harde, thought it was vaine so long to beate about the bush: therefore he thought to haue giuen her a fresh charge: but he was so preuented by certaine of his men, who missing their maister, came posting to seeke him: seeing that he was gone foorth all alone, yet before they drewe so nie that they might heare their talke, he vsed these speeches.</p>

<p>Why <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, perhappes I loue thee, and then thou must needes yeelde, for thou knowest I can commaunde and constraine. Trueth sir (quoth she) but not to loue: for constrained loue is force, not loue: and know this sir, mine honesty is such, as I hadde rather dye then be a <hi rend="italic">Concubine</hi> euen to a King, and my birth is so base as I am vnfitte to bee a wife to a poore farmer. Why then (quoth he) thou canst not loue <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>? Yes saide <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, when <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> becomes a shepheard, and with that the presence of his men broke off their parle, so that he went with them to the palace, and left <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> sitting still on the hill side, who seeing that the night drewe on, shifted her fouldes, and busied her selfe about other worke to driue away such fond fancies as began to trouble her braine. But all this could not preuaile, for the beautie of <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> had made such a deepe impression in her heart, as it could not be worne out without cracking, so that she was forced to blame her owne folly in this wise.</p>

<p>Ah <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, why doest thou gaze against the Sunne, or catch at the Winde: starres are to be looked at with the eye, not reacht at with the hande: thoughts are to be measured by Fortunes, not by desires: falles come not by sitting low, but by climing too hie: what then shall al feare to fal, because some <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="E2v" xml:id="pan_sig_E2v_88" ed="1588">[E2<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>]</milestone> happe to fall?

In the meane time <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> was not slacke in his affaires, but applyed his matters with such diligence, that he prouided all thinges fitte for their iourney. <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0085"/>Treasure and Iewels he had gotten great store, thincking there was no better friend than money in a strange countrey: rich attire he had prouided for <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, and, because he could not bring the matter to passe without the helpe and aduice of some one, he made an old seruant of his called <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>, who had serued him from his childhood, priuie to his affaires: who seeing no perswasions could preuaile to diuert him from his setled determination, gaue his consent and dealt so secretly in the cause, that within short space, hee had gotten a ship ready for their passage: the Mariners seeing a fit gale of winde for their purpose, wished <name rend="italic">Capnio</name> to make no delayes, <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="F1v" xml:id="pan_sig_F1v_88" ed="1588">[F1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>]</milestone> least if they pretermitted this good weather, they might stay long ere they had such a fayre winde. <name rend="italic">Capnio</name> fearing that his negligence should hinder the iourney, in the night time conueyed the trunckes full of treasure into the shippe, and by secrete meanes let <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> vnderstand, that the next morning they meant to depart: she vpon this newes slept verie little that night, but gotte vp very early, and wente to her sheepe, looking euery minute when she should see <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, who taried not long, for fear delay might breede daunger, but came as fast as he could gallop, and without any great circumstance tooke <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> vp behinde him and rode to the hauen, where the shippe lay, which was not three quarters of a mile distant from that place. He no sooner came there, but the Marriners were readie with their Cockboate to set them aboard, where being coucht together in a Cabben they past away the time in recounting their old loues, til their man <name rend="italic">Capnio</name> should come. <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> who had heard that this morning the King would go abroad to take the ayre, called in haste to his wife to bring him his holyday hose and his best Iacket, that he might goe like an honest substantiall man to tell his tale. His wife, a good cleanly wenche, brought him all things fitte, and spungd him vp very handsomlie, giuing him the chaines and Iewels in a little boxe, which <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> for the more safety put in his bosom. Hauing thus all his trinkets in a readines, taking his staffe in his hand he bad his wife kisse him for good lucke, and so hee went towards the Pallace. But as he was going, fortune (who meant to showe him a little false play) preuented his purpose in this wise.</p>

<p>He met by chaunce in his way <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>, who trudging as fast as he could with a little coffer vnder his arme to the ship, and spying <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> whome he knewe to be <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>s Father, going towardes the Pallace, being a wylie fellow, began to doubt the worst, and therefore crost him the way, and askt him whither he was going so earely this morning.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Porrus</name> (who knew by his face that he was one of the Court) meaning simply, told him that the Kings son <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> dealt hardly with him; for he had but one Daughter who was a little beautifull, and that his neighboures told him the young <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="F2" xml:id="pan_sig_F2_88" ed="1588">[F2]</milestone> Prince had allured her to folly, he went therefore now to complaine to the King how greatly he was abused.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0072"><name rend="italic">Capnio</name> (who straight way smelt the whole matter) began to soothe him in his talke, and said, that <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> dealt not like a Prince to spoyle any poore manes daughter in that sort: he therefore would doe the best for him he could, because he knew he was an honest man. But (quoth <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>) you lose your labour in going to the Pallace, for [<hi rend="smcaps">tln</hi> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2642" targetEnd="#tln_2645">2642–5</ref>] the King meanes this day to take the aire of the Sea, and to goe aboord of a shippe that lies in the hauen. I am going before, you see, to prouide all things in redinesse, and if you will follow my counsaile, turne back with me to the hauen, where I will set you in such a fitte place as you may speake to the King at your pleasure. <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> giuing credit to <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>s smooth tale, gaue him a thousand thanks for his friendly aduise, and went with him to the hauen, making all the way his complaintes of <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, yet concealing secretlie the chaine and the Iewels. Assone as they were come to the Sea side, the marriners seeing <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>, came a land with their cockboate, who still dissembling the matter, demaunded of <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> if he would go see the ship? who vnwilling and fearing the worst, because he was not well acquainted with <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>, made his excuse that he could not brooke the Sea, therefore would not trouble him.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Capnio</name> seeing that by faire meanes hee could not get him aboord, commaunded the mariners that by violence they should carrie him into the shippe, who like sturdy knaues hoisted the poore shepheard on their backes, and bearing him to the boate, lanched from the land.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Porrus</name> seeing himselfe so cunningly betraied durst not crie out, for hee sawe it would not preuaile, but began to intreate <name rend="italic">Capnio</name> and the mariners to be good to him, and to pittie his estate, hee was but a poore man that liued by his labour: they laughing to see the shepheard so afraide, made as much haste as they could, and set him aboorde. <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> was no sooner in the shippe, but he saw <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> walking with <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, yet he scarse knew her: for she had attired her selfe in riche apparell, which<anchor type="fn" xml:id="fna_039" corresp="#fnn_039" marker="39"/><note type="source" place="foot" xml:id="fnn_039" target="#fna_039" marker="39"><app><lem>which&caret;</lem>] <appPart><rdg type="lem">&swdash;</rdg> <wit>1607</wit></appPart>; <appPart><rdg>&swdash;,</rdg> <wit>1588</wit></appPart></app></note> so increased her beauty, that shee resembled rather an Angell than a mortall creature.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> praised greatly his mans deuise, and allowed of his counsaile; but <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, (who stil feared <name rend="italic">Porrus</name>, as her father) began to blush for shame, that by her meanes he should either incure daunger or displeasure.</p>

<p>The old shephard hearing this hard sentence, that he should on such a sodaine be caried from his Wife, his country, and kinsfolke, into a forraine Lande amongst straungers, began with bitter teares to make his complaint, and on his knees to intreate <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, that pardoning his vnaduised folly he would giue him leaue to goe home: swearing that hee would keepe all thinges as secret as they could wish. But these protestations could not preuaile, although <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> intreated <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> very earnestly, but the mariners hoisting their maine sailes waied ankers, and hailed into the deepe, where we leaue them to the fauour of the wind and seas, and returne to <name rend="italic">Egistus</name>.</p>

<p>Who hauing appointed this day to hunt in one of his Forrests, called for his sonne <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> to go sport himselfe, because hee saw that of late hee began to loure; but his men made answer that hee was gone abroade none knew whither, except he were gone to the groue to walke all alone, as his custome was to doe euery day.</p>

<p>The King willing to waken him out of his dumpes, sent one of his men to goe seeke him, but in vaine, for at last he returned, but finde him he could not, so that the King went himselfe to goe see the sport; where passing away the day, returning at night from hunting, hee asked for his sonne, but he could not be heard of, which draue the King into a great choler: whereupon most of his Noblemen and other Courtiers poasted abroad to seek him, but they could not heare of him through all <hi rend="italic">Sicilia</hi>, onely they missed <name rend="italic">Capnio</name> his man which againe <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="F3" xml:id="pan_sig_F3_88" ed="1588">[F3]</milestone> made the King suspect that hee was not gone farre.</p>

<p>Two or three daies being passed, and no newes heard of <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, <name rend="italic">Egistus</name> began to feare that he was deuoured with some wilde beastes, and vpon that made out a great troupe of men to go seeke him; who coasted through all the Country, and searched in euerie daungerous and secrete place, vntill at last they mette with a Fisherman that was sitting in a little couert hard by the sea side mending his nettes, when <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> and <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> tooke shipping: who being examined if he either knewe or heard where the Kings Sonne was, without any secrecie at all reuealed the whole matter, how he was sayled two dayes past, had in his company his man <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>, <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> and his faire Daughter <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>.

<p xml:id="para_0071">But his sonne <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> little regarded either father, countrie, or Kingdome in respect of his Lady <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, for fortune smyling on this young nouice, lent him so lucky a gale of winde, for the space of a day and a night, that the maryners lay and slept vpon the hatches; but on the next morning about the breake of the day, the aire began to be ouercast, the winds to rise, the seas to swel, yea presently [<hi rend="smcaps">tln</hi> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2408">2408</ref>] there arose such a fearfull tempest, as the ship was in danger to be swallowed vp with euery sea, the maine mast with the violence of the wind was thrown <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="F3v" xml:id="pan_sig_F3v_88" ed="1588">[F3<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>]</milestone> ouer boord, the sayles were torne, the tacklings went in sunder, the storme raging still so furiously that poore <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> was almost dead for feare, but that she was greatly comforted with the presence of <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>. The tempest continued three dayes, al which time the Mariners euerie minute looked for death, and the aire was so darkned with cloudes that the Maister could not tell by his compasse in what Coast they were. But vpon the fourth day about ten of the clocke, the wind began to cease, the sea to waxe calme, and the sky to be cleare, and the Mariners descryed the coast of <name rend="italic">Bohemia</name>, shooting of their ordnance for ioy that they had escaped such a fearefull tempest.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> hearing that they were arriued at some harbour, sweetly kissed <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, and bad her be of good cheare: when they tolde him that the port belonged vnto the cheife Cittie of <name rend="italic">Bohemia</name> where <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name> kept his Court, <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> began to be sad, knowing that his Father hated no man so much as <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name>, and that the King himself had sought secretly to betray <name rend="italic">Egistus</name>: this considered, he was halfe afraid to goe on land, but that <name rend="italic">Capnio</name> counselled him to chaunge his name and his countrey, vntil such time as they could get some other barke to transport them into <hi rend="italic">Italy.

The shipmen willing to shew what friendship they could to <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, promised to be as secret as they could, or hee might wish, and vppon this they landed in a little village a mile distant from the Citie, where after they had rested a day, thinking to make prouision for their mariage, <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0030-a"/>the fame of <name rend="italic">Fawnias</name> beauty was spread throughout all the Citie, so that it came to the eares of <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name>, who then [<hi rend="smcaps">tln</hi> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2240">2240</ref>] being about the age of fifty, had notwithstanding yong and freshe affections:<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0030-b"/> so that he desired greatly to see <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, and to bring this matter the better to passe, hearing they had but one man, and how they rested at a very homely house, he caused them to be apprehended as spies, and sent a dozen of his garde to take them: who being come to their lodging, tolde them the Kings message. <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> no <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="F4" xml:id="pan_sig_F4_88" ed="1588">[F4]</milestone> whit dismayed, accompanied with <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> and <name rend="italic">Capnio</name>, went to the court (for they left <name rend="italic">Porrus</name> to keepe the stuffe) who being admitted to the Kings presence,<anchor type="fn" xml:id="fna_042" corresp="#fnn_042" marker="42"/><note type="source" place="foot" xml:id="fnn_042" target="#fna_042" marker="42"><app><lem>presence,</lem>] <appPart><rdg type="lem">&swdash;</rdg> <wit>1592</wit></appPart>; <appPart><rdg>&swdash;.</rdg> <wit>1588</wit></appPart></app></note> <name rend="italic"> Dorastus</name> and <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name> with humble obeysance saluted his maiestie.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Meleagrus</name>, I feare this smooth tale hath but small trueth, and that thou couerest a foule skin with faire paintings. No doubt this Ladie by her grace and beauty is of her degree more meete for a mighty Prince, then for a simple knight, and thou like a periured traitour hast bereft her of her parents, to their present griefe, and her insuing sorrow.

<p><name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, in whome rested nothing but Kingly valor, was not able to suffer the reproches of <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name>, but that he made him this answer.</p>

<p>It is not meete for a King, without due proofe to appeach any man of ill behauiour, nor vpon suspition to inferre beleefe: straungers ought to bee entertained with courtesie, not to bee intreated with crueltie, least being forced by want to put vp iniuries, the Gods reuenge their cause with rigor.</p>

Alas, I reach at that with my hand which my hart would faine refuse: playing like the bird <hi rend="italic">Ibys</hi> in Egipt, which hateth Serpents, yet feedeth on their egges.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0074">Tush, hot desires turne oftentimes to colde disdaine: Loue is brittle, where appetite, not reason, beares the sway.

But on a day, walking; abroad into a Parke which was hard adioyning to his house, he sent by one of his seruants for <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, [see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2746">2995</ref>] vnto whome he vttered these wordes.</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, I commend thy beauty and wit, and now pittie thy distresse and want: but if you wilt forsake Sir <name rend="italic">Meleagrus</name>, whose pouerty, though a Knight, is not able to maintaine an estate aunswerable to thy beauty, and yeld thy consent to <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name>, I wil both increase thee with dignities and riches. No sir, answered <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>: <name rend="italic">Meleagrus</name> is a knight that hath wonne me by loue, and none but he shal [<hi rend="smcaps">tln</hi> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_404">404</ref>] weare me: his sinister mischance shall not diminishe my affection, but rather increase my good will. Thinke not though your Grace hath imprisoned him without cause, that feare shall make mee yeeld my consent: I had rather be <name rend="italic">Meleagrus</name> wife, and a beggar, then liue in plenty, and be <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name>s Concubine. <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name>, hearing the assured aunswere of <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, would, notwithstanding, prosecute his suite to the vttermost: seeking with faire words and great promises to scale the fort of her chastitie, swearing that if she would graunt to his desire, <name rend="italic">Meleagrus</name> should not only be set at libertie, but honored in his courte amongst his Nobles: but these alluring baytes could not intise her minde from the loue of her newe betrothed mate <name rend="italic">Meleagrus</name>: which <name rend="italic">Pandosto</name> seeing, he left her alone for that time to consider more of the demaund. <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, being alone by her selfe, began to enter into these solitarie meditations.</p>

<p>Ah, infortunate <name rend="italic">Fawnia</name>, thou seest to desire aboue fortune is to striue against the Gods and Fortune. Who gazeth at the sunne weakeneth his sight: they which stare at the skie, fall oft into deepe pits: haddest thou rested content to haue been a shepheard, thou neededst not to haue feared mischaunce. Better had it bene for thee, by sitting lowe, to haue had quiet, then by climing high to haue fallen into miserie. But alas, I feare not mine owne daunger, but <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> displeasure. Ah sweete <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name>, thou art a Prince, but now a prisoner, by too much <milestone unit="sig_pan" n="G1v" xml:id="pan_sig_G1v_88" ed="1588">[G1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>]</milestone> loue procuring thine owne losse.

No; would my death might deliuer him, so mine honor might be preserued. With that, fetching a deepe sigh, she ceased from her complaints, and went againe to the Pallace, inioying a libertie without content, and profered pleasure with smal ioy. But poore <name rend="italic">Dorastus</name> lay all this while in close prison, being pinched with a hard restraint, and pained with the burden of colde, and heauie Irons, sorrowing sometimes that his fond affection had procured him this mishappe, that by the disobedience of his parentes, he had wrought his owne despight: an other while cursing the Gods and fortune, that they should crosse him with such sinister chaunce: vttering at last his passions in these words.</p>

<p>Ah vnfortunate wretch, borne to mishappe, now thy folly hath his desert: Art thou not worthie for thy base minde to haue bad fortune? could the destinies fauour thee, which hast forgot thine honor and dignities?

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_upt1746"><name type="app">Upton</name></ref> (1746, pp. 40–1) finds Sh. culpable for the major error of basing a play on <title level="m">Pandosto</title> and for minor errors of execution. To explain, he invokes the Aristotelian defects of poetry—one <quote>arises from itself, &lt;per se,&gt; the other is accidental: &lt;<foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">per accidens</foreign>:&gt; for if it chuses subjects for imitation, out of its power and reach, the fault is from itself; &lt;per se,&gt; but when it chooses ignorantly, the fault is accidental.</quote> The defect per se is <quote>the [<hi rend="italic">41</hi>] making choice of such a story as the <title level="m">Winter’s Tale</title>, &amp;c.&hellip; The [defect <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">per accidens</foreign>] is where Shakespeare, not heeding geography, calls Delphi an isle.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_warb"><name type="app">Warburton</name></ref> (ed. 1747, 3:277) despises the source but praises the play: it is <quote>written in the very spirit of its author.&hellip; This was necessary to observe in mere justice to the Play, as the meanness of the fable, and the extravagant conduct of it, had misled some of great name [Dryden and Pope] into a wrong judgment of its merit; which, as far as it regards sentiment and character, is scarce inferior to any in the whole collection.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0013"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_len1753"><name type="app">Lennox</name></ref> (1753, 2:75–87), however, is of just the opposite opinion: <quote>If we compare the Conduct of the Incidents in the Play with the paltry Story on which it is founded, we shall find the Original much less absurd and ridiculous.&hellip; The King’s Jealousy is the Foundation of all the Adventures that followed, but extravagant as its Consequences are in both, yet the Rise and Progress of this terrible Passion is better accounted for in the Novel than the Play.</quote> She recounts the incidents in <title level="m">Pandosto</title> leading to the onset of the King’s jealousy, concluding (p. 76): <quote>This Account&hellip;does not absolutely clash with Probability.</quote> She summarizes the action of <title level="m">WT</title> to line <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_116">116</ref> approximately. (P. 77): <quote part="I"><name rend="italic">Polixenes</name> complies at her [Hermione’s] Request [to extend his visit], and certainly he must be a very ill bred Monarch had he done otherwise.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">All [their] Conversation passes in the Presence of <name rend="italic">Leontes</name>, who from hence takes Occasion to be jealous, and passes in an Instant from the greatest Confidence, Security, and Friendship imaginable, to the last Extremity of Jealousy and Rage.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cap1783"><name type="app">Capell</name></ref> (1783, 3:233–4) disagrees with Lennox, as one might expect: <quote>This miserable story [<title level="m">Pandosto</title>]—writ in the days of Euphuism, as appears from the style of it—is not so exactly followed by <name type="lit" rend="lscaps">Shakespeare</name> as some have conceited; <name rend="italic">Bellaria</name> (his [Greene’s] <name rend="italic"> Hermione</name>) does not come to life again, but dies in good earnest when her son dies; and <title level="m">Pandosto</title>, (his <name rend="italic">Leontes</name>) when all is over, his daughter found again, and marry’d to her lover, falls into a melancholy, and kills himself. These are the principal differences between him and the story-writer with respect to the fable: the language it is dress’d in, (some expressions excepted, which [<hi rend="italic">234</hi>] are of small importance) the characters, the sentiments, are all his own; and he has also enrich’d it with the following additional characters,—<name rend="italic">Antigonus</name>, and his wife <name rend="italic">Paulina</name>; the shepherd’s son, &amp; his mistresses; <name rend="italic">Autolicus</name>, and some others. For the rest,—the story he chose to follow is adher’d to a little too closely, and (namely) without sufficient attention to one capital absurdity respecting the scene of it: some excuse may be made for him, that will be found in another place [see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1387-02">1440</ref>].</quote> Among others disagreeing with Lennox is <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_esc1801"><name type="app">Eschenburg</name></ref> (ed. 1801, 5:210), who defends Sh.’s depiction of the quirks of human nature; the playwright, he says, demonstrates quite profoundly how easily the ember of jealousy may burst into an all-consuming flame.</p>

<p>A more detailed analysis of Sh.’s debt is made by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sko1824"><name type="app">Skottowe</name></ref> (1824, 2:290–300). <quote>The novel marks the growth of this passion [jealousy] in the king; in the play it is instantaneous and uncontrollable.&hellip; With the forlorn hope of saving the infant’s [Perdita’s] life, Anti-[<hi rend="italic">291</hi>]gonus&hellip;consents to carry it to a desert place&hellip;and there leave it.&hellip; In the novel, the king exposes the child in an open boat to the mercy of the wind and waves.&hellip; Greene’s tyrant resolves to burn both the mother and the child; but the queen’s demand for an open trial is warmly seconded by the nobility, and the king prudently consents to send six of his nobility to the <hi rend="italic">Isle</hi> of Delphos.&hellip; In [<title level="m">WT</title>], the embassy originates with Leontes himself.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">299</hi>] If not a more natural, Shakspeare has certainly substituted a more agreeable conclusion to his drama. Indeed, few scenes of greater interest, and none managed with a more consummate knowledge of stage effect, are to be met with [<hi rend="italic">300</hi>] than that which closes the Winter’s Tale. With the exception of this striking scene, Shakspeare has done little towards the improvement of the story he worked from; but he was more successful in his delineation of its principal characters.</quote></p>

Although the circumstances of the child’s exposure are different, Shakspere adopts the shepherd’s discovery pretty literally.&hellip; The infant in the novel is taken to the shepherd’s home, and is brought up by his wife and himself under the name of Fawnia. In a narrative the lapse of sixteen years may occur without any violation of propriety.

The secret of Fawnia’s birth is discovered by the shepherd; and her father recognises her. But the previous circumstances exhibit as much grossness of conception on the part of the novelist [Knight probably alludes to Pandosto’s attraction to Fawnia, <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0009"/>.], as the different management of the catastrophe shows the matchless skill and taste of the dramatist.

It is better than Lodge’s Rosalynd [the source of <title level="m">AYL</title>] for this reason, if for no other, that it is shorter.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">13</hi>] In the novel Paulina and the Clown are wanting altogether, and Capnio yields but a slight hint, if indeed it be so much, towards the part of Autolycus. And, besides the great addition of life and matter in these persons, the play has several other judicious departures from the novel. In Leontes all the revolting features of Pandosto, save his jealousy and the headstrong insolence and tyranny consequent thereon, are purged away; so that while the latter has neither intellect nor generosity to redeem his character, jealousy being the least of his faults, the other has a liberal stock of both. And in Bellaria the Poet had little more than a bare framework of incident wherein to set the noble, lofty womanhood of Hermione,—a conception far, far above the reach of such a mind as Greene’s. In the matter of the painted statue Shakespeare, so far as we know, was altogether without a model.&hellip; Hermione’s character&hellip;is the shaping and informing power of the whole drama&hellip;the prolific germ out of which the entire work is evolved.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_wh1"><name type="app">White</name></ref> (ed. 1857, 5:271–2), in comparing the two characters, agrees with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_len1753"><name type="app">Lennox</name></ref> (p. 656): <quote>Greene gives <title level="m">Pandosto</title> more cause for his jealousy than Shakespeare gives to <name rend="italic">Leontes</name>.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gerg1877"><name type="app">Gervinus</name></ref> (1863, 2:467–8): <quote>Shakespeare has done with this narrative, as he usually did with his bad originals, he has done away with some indelicacy in the matter, and some unnatural things in the form; he has given a better foundation to the characters and course of events; but to impart an intrinsic value to the subject as a whole, to bring a double action into unity, and to give the play the character of a regular drama by mere arrangements of matter and alteration of motive, was not possible. The wildness of the fiction, the improbability and contingency of the events, the gap in the time&hellip;could not be repaired by any art. Shakespeare, therefore, began upon his theme in quite an opposite direction. He increased still more the marvellous and miraculous in the given subject, he disregarded more and more the requirements of the real and probable, and treated time, place, and circumstances with the utmost arbitrariness.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">468</hi>] The scenic effect, the excellent characterization of certain personages, the beauty of the language of the play were acknowledged [by early critics], but the poet was continually upbraided for those very marvels, which we think he did not introduce as any thing else.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wig1884"><name type="app">Wigston</name></ref> (1884, p. 3): <quote>In borrowing Greene’s story, he [Sh.] took it on account of its title [see <ptr targType="docTitle" target="#pan_doctitle"/>], in relation to its subject matter,—disharmony and separation, followed by reconciliation and heavenly harmony as in Cymbeline and Pericles,—the exposure of an infant and its re-discovery through time.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_morh1887"><name type="app">Morley</name></ref> (ed. 1887, pp. 8–9): <quote>To change a real to a supposed death, required invention of means of concealment, and this requirement was met by the creation of the character of Paulina.&hellip; Shakespeare gives&hellip;a husband to Paulina, Antigonus, who is of gentle heart, though he obeys the evil bidding of the king, and the infant is committed to the waves, surrounded by the tenderest care until the hour of its exposure upon a coast not found by chance, but chosen at the bidding of a dream. This done, the poet gets rid of the men who are no longer wanted in the story, and who would be in the way if they lived and returned to Sicily. He gives emphasis at the same time to the peril of the child by destroying the ship and its crew in a storm at sea, and giving Antigonus to a wild beast on land, <quote>so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were [<hi rend="italic">9</hi>] even then lost when it was found</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3079" targetEnd="#tln_3081">3079–81</ref>]. In the following scenes dramatic life could not have been put into the telling of the tale without the addition of the shepherd’s son. His wife, who is in Greene’s tale, could not have been used for the purposes served by Shakespeare’s invention of the clownish son and of the rogue Autolycus. Greene uses the shepherd’s wife as a means for bringing about the solution of the plot, and had the shepherd carried off by force upon the ship of the offended king. Shakespeare removes several improbabilities, and gets rid of incidents that mar the grace of the tale, including Pandosto’s animal love for his unrecognised daughter. His changes in the manner of bringing about the solution of the plot, as far as concerns Florizel and Perdita, are mainly produced by his invention of Autolycus, the merry rogue—a cashiered courtier—who sings his songs at the sheep-shearing, fleeces the rustics, and half in hope to recover favour with the prince, sends the witnesses who can untie the knot of the tale on board the prince’s ship to Sicily. It is enough to suggest playfully that Florizel and Perdita were too full of their affairs to ask many questions of other people, and that they were sea-sick as well as love-sick. The reader who follows attentively Shakespeare’s use of Autolycus as a means of putting dramatic life into the solution of the plot without spoiling the pastoral grace and playfulness of that part of the story, will see that but for his trick in sending the bearers of the fardel to the Prince’s ship instead of to the King, Perdita must have been identified before the persons of the story were about Leontes in the close.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sni1890"><name type="app">Snider</name></ref> (c. 1890, pp. 502–3): <quote>The central fact is that Shakespeare turns Greene’s novel, which is tragic, into a comedy or mediated drama. Both Hermione (Bellaria) and Leontes (Pandosto) perish in the novel; the world of mediation is essentially unknown to Greene. The wife breaks down under her trials, when her boy Garinter (Mamillius) dies; she has not sufferance, which saves herself, her husband, her world. Still, the novelist dwells upon her purity, nay, he speaks of her patience, but it bears no fruit in his work, it is not the triumphant patience of the Poet. In like manner Leontes shows repentance in Greene’s book, but it is not that complete undoing of guilt which bridges the great chasm and brings restoration of wife, child, and world. Through these two ideas—the repentance of the husband and the long-suffering of the wife—the whole play is changed into a purgatorial discipline, with the outlook of salvation; the two characters are me-[<hi rend="italic">503</hi>]diated and brought back even into their secular existence.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_nlsn"><name type="app">Neilson</name></ref> (ed. 1906, p. 419): <quote>The superb dignity of Hermione which almost lifts her above pity, the plain-spoken loyalty of Paulina, the peculiar poetic charm of the pastoral scenes of which Perdita is the centre, the humor of the rogue and the rustics, the elements, in short, which make the play delightful, are all Shakespeare’s. To Greene belongs the credit of framing an interesting romantic story, the improbabilities and surprises of which Shakespeare seems to have taken no pains to abate, but which, on the contrary, he capped by devising a closing situation, theatrically effective, indeed, but more defiant of likelihood than anything in his source.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thop07"><name type="app">Thomas</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">Pandosto</title>, 1907, pp. xi–xiii): <quote part="I">Greene’s style is, of course, characteristic of himself, and his pleasant conceits find no place in Shakespeare’s mature drama.

Greene is often coarse, but he has that Elizabethan gift of sweetness, which is unmistakable.

There is no counterpart in the novel of the pathetic scene in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>, in which the [<hi rend="italic">xiii</hi>] character of young Mamillius is developed.&hellip;In the same way, Greene’s reference to the storm at sea is expanded into Act III. sc. iii of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_por1908"><name type="app">Porter</name> &amp; <name type="app">Clarke</name></ref> (ed. 1908, pp. 124–5): <quote part="I">There are events in Greene’s plot which Shakespeare altogether discards: The refusal of the prince to marry a Danish princess to suit his father, before he meets the shepherdess; the fear of the shepherd and his wife&hellip;lest the prince will bring shame upon their daughter. This fear is very important in Greene’s plot, for it causes them,—gossip as to the prince’s familiarity with their foster-daughter being brought to their ears,—to decide to tell the king that she is not their own child. It will be noticed that Shakespeare not only discards this, he invents the king’s presence at the betrothal in its stead, and this in the play frightens the shepherd and his son (who takes the place of the wife in Greene’s story) into confession.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Autolicus is not in Greene; but in Greene’s plot a servant of the prince, named Capnio, plays soberly the part which Autolicus plays humorously in Shakespeare’s plot by intercepting the shepherd on his way to confess to the king, and enticing him on shipboard.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">In Act V. the restoration of the castaway daughter and the union of the young lovers are based on the same events as in Greene’s plot, but they are brought about by so different a manipulation of the incidents that there is scarcely anything in common save the arrival in port, in the country of the jealous king, of the eloping lovers and the old shepherd.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">All that Camillo and Paulina effect in Act V. is not in Greene.

The confession of the old shepherd then following, the king, ashamed of his action toward his own daughter, kills himself.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">All that defeats such misery as this, which in Greene’s plot so mars his union of the young lovers, is due to Shakespeare.</quote></p>

<p>According to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stoc16"><name type="app">Stopes</name></ref> (1916, pp. 32–8), the playwright reverses Greene’s emotional geography, sending the hot-blooded Leontes to Sicily, the cooler Polixenes to Bohemia: (p. 33) <quote>Shakespeare evolves the character of Antigonus out of one of the Chief Lords</quote>&hellip;(p. 35) but <quote>does not allow Antigonus to cast the babe away in a small boat, to find Bohemia.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_pie1918"><name type="app">Pierce</name></ref> (ed. 1918, p. 129) similarly: <quote>By interchanging throughout the parts of Bohemia and Sicily he [Sh.] probably meant to veil the extent of his debt to a book that was still popular, although he may have believed that the suddenness of Leontes’ jealousy would seem truer to life in a hot-blooded Sicilian than in a native of Central Europe.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_kit1"><name type="app">Kittredge</name></ref> (ed. 1936, p. 432): <quote>Some significant variations [from <title level="m">Pandosto</title>] may be noted[:] Apollo is consulted at the request of the queen. The king does not blaspheme when the oracle is read in court; he repents instantly and is making public confession when word is brought that his son is dead. This news is fatal to the queen.&hellip; The baby is not left on the shore; it is abandoned at sea (like Prospero and Miranda in <title level="m">The Tempest</title>) in a boat without sail or rudder, which comes safe to land by good fortune after a mighty storm. Antigonus and Paulina have no prototypes in the novel and Shakespeare’s Camillo combines the rôles of two of Greene’s characters. The old shepherd comes from the novel, but his son and Dorcas and Mopsa and Autolycus are all new characters. Rustic revels are mentioned in the tale, but not described.&hellip; The novel has a happy ending, so far as the young people are concerned, but Pandosto&hellip;is a tragic personage throughout. After years of mourning for his dead wife, he falls in love with Fawnia&hellip; , whom of course he supposes to be the shepherd’s daughter.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pru38"><name type="app">Pruvost</name></ref> (1938, p. 573): Among these [Greene’s romances] his <title level="m">Pandosto</title> seems to occupy a place apart because it offers one of the first uses in England, if not the first, of a theme in which the love of children comes to restore the concord and harmony destroyed by the discords and the defects of parents. It is precisely the theme that Shakespeare handled several times toward the end of his career. Would he have done so if Greene had not written his <title level="m">Pandosto</title>? It is not impossible. But since in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> he dramatized Greene’s romance, one does not in the least exaggerate the influence of Greene in saying that he furnished Shakespeare the very special formula of the last plays (in Fr.).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mui57"><name type="app">Muir</name></ref> (1957, p. 241): <quote part="I">Shakespeare follows the earlier part of the source fairly closely. Greene described how the guard was sent to arrest Bellaria [quotes <quote>comming&hellip;sonne</quote> (<ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0015-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0015-b"/>)]. On this hint Shakespeare constructed the scene&hellip;in which Mamillius begins his interrupted tale [2.1]. But Leontes himself, not merely the guard, comes in to order Hermione’s arrest.&hellip; [<title level="m">Pandosto</title>’s] order of events is quite satisfactory in a prose narrative, but it lacks dramatic tension. Shakespeare realized that he would spoil Hermione’s speech at the trial, in which she appeals to the oracle, if he allowed her to appeal to the oracle in a previous scene [as Bellaria does]; so he made Leontes himself decide to send a deputation to Apollo’s temple at Delphos in order to satisfy other people. The substance of the oracle is not known until it is read out at the trial, and the King immediately declares that there is no truth in it. News is brought that Mamillius has died, and we assume, as Leontes himself does, that this is a judgement from Apollo on account of his blasphemy. Hermione faints, and Pauline [sic] brings word that she is dead. Bellaria is indeed dead; but Hermione recovers, unknown to Leontes.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The only substantial passage in the novel which Shakespeare borrows with comparatively little alteration is Bellaria’s speech at the trial [quotes <quote>If the deuine&hellip;Oracle</quote> (<ptr targType="p" target="#para_0011"/>)].</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel66b"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (<title level="a">Romance,</title> 1966, pp. 64–5, 69–70): <quote part="I"><title level="m">Pandosto</title> is a collection of clichés, the well-worn themes and stock situations of pastoral romance.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">65</hi>] During the play we are reminded of the old-fashioned nature of the story we are watching. By a sort of alienation technique Shakespeare draws our attention to the nature of the fiction [as at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1590" targetEnd="#tln_1594">1590–4</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3070">3070</ref>, and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3327" targetEnd="#tln_3328">3327–8</ref>].&hellip; It appears not only that Shakespeare was fully aware of the unrealities of the story, but that he deliberately played upon the audience’s awareness too, inviting them to recall similar situations—even perhaps their memories of the source story itself, and also the centuries of tradition that lie behind it.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Shakespeare’s handling of <title level="m">Pandosto</title> is characterized at once by extreme freedom and by a remarkable willingness to turn to account even minute details of the original. He both takes over the episodic structure and draws attention to it in the long speech of Time as chorus [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1580" targetEnd="#tln_1611">1580–1611</ref>]. This emphasis seems designed to stress the romantic nature of the tale: in the non-dramatic romances, time is commonly the ally of chance and fortune in bringing about the changes of the actions. Time’s speech is pivotal to the play. Shakespeare may have got the idea for it from Greene’s subtitle, which is <title level="m">The Triumph of Time</title>; and Greene’s title-page bears the tag <quote xml:lang="la" xml:id="quote_021">temporis filia veritas</quote> [<quote type="trans" corresp="#quote_021">truth is the daughter of time</quote>]. Certainly Shakespeare makes of the time element a poetic complex that helps in giving the play a richness of harmony without parallel in the novel. Showing how human beings can achieve at least the illusion of having triumphed over time, Shakespeare creates that illusion for us.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">[<hi rend="italic">69</hi>] In <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> there are no macrocosmic implications.

Still less was it necessary for Shakespeare to make Paulina not only the fearless accuser of Leontes in his jealousy but also the guide of his actions and keeper of his conscience during the period of remorse. Never, perhaps, in drama has there been so grand an extension of the <quote>confidente’s</quote> [sic] role.</quote> Pilgrim also describes the development of Camillo from Greene’s Franion and of Leontes from Pandosto.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg75"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1975, 8:123–32): <quote part="I">Shakespeare’s main departures from Greene are as follows: names and settings are changed; the king’s jealousy is speeded up, with consequent loss of probability; Leontes himself sends to consult the Oracle before his wife’s trial, and does not, like Pandosto, do so only when his wife demands it; unlike Pandosto Leontes rejects the Oracle’s verdict, and his im-[<hi rend="italic">124</hi>]mediate bereavements are seen as punishments for blasphemy. Paulina is a new character and her continuing part is original; the child is not cast adrift in a boat but taken to Bohemia by Antigonus, another new character. Shakespeare introduces a bear to kill him, and a storm to sink the ship. Polixenes is present at the shearing-feast, which, with the entertainment offered there, is also new; likewise Autolycus and his tricks. <title level="m">Pandosto</title> lacks the broad humour of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>, and also the discussion of ethical topics. The emotional intensity and poetic feeling of the piece are of course Shakespeare’s own.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">132</hi>] The repentance of Pandosto [for his wife’s death] is noted by Greene but not emphasized, and nothing is made of it when he meets his unknown daughter after sixteen years. Instead, he keeps her lover in prison, and tries to seduce her, then, being refused, is willing to have her killed to please Egistus. Leontes, however, aided by that embodied conscience Paulina&hellip;is made to suffer the torments of remorse until the last moments of the play, and, looking back over the dialogue, it is obvious that from the moment when Paulina brought news of Hermione’s supposed death [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1358">1358</ref> ff.] the intention was to bring her back.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Shakespeare’s reasons for this drastic departure from his source were complex. He had already [dealt with recognitions in <title level="m">Per.</title> and reconciliations in <title level="m">Cym.</title>]. If the new play was to have such an ending [as <title level="m">Cym.</title>] it would be impossible to take over Greene’s backsliding Pandosto&hellip;and to have him mar his daughter’s marriage either by living on or committing suicide. On the other hand, to leave Leontes in penitential misery without any recompense would be both harsh and undramatic. Above all, Shakespeare [wanted not mere entertainment] but a thought-provoking piece with strong ethical and religious overtones.&hellip; He now invents a variant on [the restoration of Hero in <title level="m">Ado</title>], the <quote>living statue</quote> of the desired woman.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_macl88"><name type="app">Mackinnon</name></ref> (1988, p. 139): <quote>The last significant action of Greene’s <title level="m">Pandosto</title>&hellip;is committed by Pandosto himself, who <quote>calling to mind</quote> all the evil he has done [<quote>fell into a melancholie fit, and to close vp the Comedie with a Tragicall stratageme, hee slew himself</quote>] [<ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0014-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0014-b"/>]. We could not ask for a clearer statement of generic purpose. However, Greene’s syntax is significantly uncertain. We are left in doubt whether the intention of the <quote>tragical stratagem</quote> is the author’s, who would here interpolate this clause as a breezy aside to his audience, or Pandosto’s, who would then assume an attitude of frozen self-regard. Such unclarity is richly suggestive, for it invites us to speculate on Pandosto’s feelings, but must finally leave us uneasy. If Greene himself is confessing to a <quote>stratagem</quote>, how tawdry his work must seem. It is also an error of taste to have Pandosto kill himself because the comic reconciliation the subtitle&hellip;promises is left incomplete. Shakespeare reverses Greene’s direction here, and closes up his tragical drama with a comical stratagem.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adar89"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1989, pp. 109–10): <quote part="I">Though king Leontes’ abrupt, unmotivated rage in the first act of <title level="m">WT</title> has been amply criticized as a deficiency in the play, not so much attention has been paid to the abrupt, unmotivated rage of king Polixenes in Act IV. In fact, <title level="m">Pandosto</title> provides both monarchs with ample motivation. Bellaria&hellip;comes close to playing fast and loose with her royal guest; Greene slyly tempts us into thinking it likely. And Egistus’ fury with his son Dorastus flares up for reasons that Elizabethans would have found instantly familiar; the father had arranged a marriage for his son&hellip;and was not going to see it disrupted by an affair with a common shepherdess. But Shakespeare made no effort to provide credible motives for Leontes/Pandosto, and discarded the motive that Greene had already provided for Polixenes/Egistus. Lacking the sort of specific motivation that would distinguish them, the two [kings] meld practically indistinguishably into identical mechanisms of suspicion, sullen repression, and abrupt fury burst-[<hi rend="italic">110</hi>]ing out into fantastic threats of burning, mutilation, and bloody execution.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">If the kings are twin bogeys, setting the two halves of the plot into motion, they play little part in the reconciliation. In the course of Act V, Leontes never addresses to his daughter a word that the audience can hear, nor does Polixenes say a word to his son; in fact, Leontes addresses only a brief sentence to Bohemia, perfunctorily begging pardon for his scandalous suspicions and his efforts to murder a sacred guest as well as a dear friend. [Adams apparently alludes to <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3361" targetEnd="#tln_3363">3361–3</ref>. Leontes’s earlier and presumably more copious apology is reported at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3061" targetEnd="#tln_3062">3061–2</ref>.] Thus&hellip;the true climax of that last scene rises from the reunion of mother and daughter.</quote></p>

<p>As mentioned above, most critics think that Sh. greatly improved Greene’s romance. The opinion of many is summed up by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sach23"><name type="app">Sachs</name></ref> (1923, p. 84): <quote>One can put one’s finger on the difference between commonplace talent and genius. [<title level="m">Pandosto</title>] is logically correct but nevertheless leaves the reader cold. In [Sh.’s] play, however, the plot is logically absurd and yet we are deeply moved by it because it is built up on deep psychological truth.</quote> Like Lennox (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0013"/>), though, a few seem less enthusiastic about his changes. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_boas1896"><name type="app">Boas</name></ref> (1896, pp. 519–20): Sh.’s <quote>ending is far more satisfactory to our moral sense [than Greene’s], and the scene where the living statue steps down from the pedestal into her husband’s arms is one of the most beautiful in the dramatist’s writings. Yet the change is not altogether an artistic improvement.&hellip; The jealousy of Pandosto towards his queen had been the prologue to the main narrative, of which Fawnia is the centre. In the course of her tangled love-romance, the girl not only secures happiness for herself, but is made by destiny, who is the presiding genius of the story, the instrument of vengeance for her mother’s wrongs. This effective bond between the opening incidents of the tale and its later stages is lost in Shakspere’s version, where the relations between the jealous king and his wife are [<hi rend="italic">520</hi>] lifted into the foreground of the action, and the fortunes of their daughter become a subordinate and almost entirely detached episode.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chal70"><name type="app">Champion</name></ref> (1970, pp. 164–5): <quote>The general alterations from&hellip;<title level="m">Pandosto</title>&hellip;heighten the fictional tone. Bellaria, for example, is a more credible character than Hermione; her reaction to her husband’s unfounded jealousy is forthright and vocal, and their alienation builds more slowly and predictably. Then, too, the transfer of the action from one kingdom to another is less contrived in Greene.</quote> In <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chal70"><name type="app">Champion</name></ref>’s view, Capnio is better motivated than Camillo to accompany the lovers, the conversation of 1.1 sounds hyperbolic, and (p. 165) <quote>one device after another confirms [<title level="m">WT</title>’s] fictional tone.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0065"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bis71"><name type="app">Biswas</name></ref> (1971, pp. 154–65), similarly: <quote>Shakespeare has modified the source-story&hellip;with the result that the story becomes sensational but the action lacks adequate motivation. For example, Leontes’ jealousy is unplausible, and the incidents of Antigonus being eaten up by a bear and of Hermione’s revival&hellip;are characteristic of romance and tragi-comedy. Even the character of Autolycus, for which Shakespeare may have derived hints from realistic portraits of London rascals, [<hi rend="italic">155</hi>] is an item in this fantasia, for he tells absurd stories of fishes that sing ballads, while relieving the rustics of their purses, and his thievery is less a crime than the inspiration of a knavish god.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">160</hi>] He [Sh.] has introduced the love affair of Perdita and Florizel much later than the corresponding episode in Greene and it is also subordinate to the main story, with which it is imperfectly blended. Shakespeare has not borrowed the horrible suggestion of incest.&hellip; But he has had to pay a price for this omission, for the two parts of the play fall apart and are less well-knit than Greene’s story.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">165</hi>] Shakespeare’s manipulation of the source materials in The Sheep-shearing Scene [4.4] confirms the impression that he used the source as merely a starting point for something different&hellip;the opposition between Fortune and Nature, Nature and Nurture.</quote></p>

This makes possible the reconciliation in the end and the joy and hope that springs from the restoration of the lost ones and Perdita’s marriage to her Prince Florizel. But it is not only in these and in several minor changes that Shakespeare betters Greene’s plot for dramatic use, but the invention and introduction of new characters.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pen2"><name type="app">Schanzer</name></ref> (ed. 1969, pp. 26–7): <quote part="I">The transformation of the novel’s young lovers is less profound than that of Pandosto, but still far-reaching.&hellip; Dorastus is ashamed of his love for the shepherdess Fawnia and tries his utmost to resist it. Like his father (and Polixenes) he sees it as dishonourable, disgraceful, calamitous. Only because he finds his love stronger than his sense of <quote>honour</quote> does he finally yield to it and, after Fawnia refuses to become his mistress, offer to make her his wife. Nothing could be further removed from Florizel’s exaltation of Perdita above any princess, his total unconcern about her social station, his declaration that [quotes <quote>I was&hellip;alike</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2287" targetEnd="#tln_2291">2287–91</ref>)].</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Fawnia’s thoughts, when she finds herself in love with the Prince, also dwell mainly on the difference of rank between them. Where for Perdita <quote>the difference forges dread</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1817">1817</ref>] because it threatens the continuance of their relationship, Fawnia sees her love for the Prince as a violation of the order of nature, and therefore likely to have dire consequences. As she is preoccupied with social [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>] rank, what pleases her most about the projected marriage to Dorastus is the thought of one day becoming queen. Hence it does not come as a surprise that when, at the end of the novel, she discovers the man who has been treating her and her lover in the most villainous fashion to be her father, we are told (apparently without the least touch of irony): <quote>Fawnia was not more joyful that she had found such a father than Dorastus was glad he should get such a wife</quote> [<ptr targType="p" target="#para_0041"/>]. We are worlds away from Perdita.&hellip; Much as he has done with Leontes, Shakespeare has made the young lovers far more attractive and lovable than are their counterparts in <title level="m">Pandosto</title>.</quote></p>

<head>Francis Sabie’s Poems</head>

<p>That Sh. may also have been indebted to an offspring of <title level="m">Pandosto</title> was suggested and more or less dismissed by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> (1930, 1:489–90): <quote>There is not much to suggest that Shakespeare used a derivative from Greene in Francis Sabie’s <title level="m">Fisherman’s Tale</title> (1595).</quote> Sabie actually wrote two poems based on Greene’s work, <title level="m">The Fissher-mans Tale</title> and a second part, <title level="m">Flora’s Fortune</title>.

<p>The stories told by these poems may be summarized as follows.</p>

<p>Driven ashore by a storm, a fisherman discovers a small stone building strangely decorated with pictures of sea gods; it is evidently a mysterious temple. An apparently aged man, who seems more divine than mortal, welcomes him, and in response to the fisherman’s inquiry, tells his tale. He is Cassander, also a fisherman. He is of noble birth, however, and once sought fame through deeds of arms. After distinguishing himself in the Holy Land and elsewhere, he served the ruler of Bohemia, who led forty thousand men against the Turkish lord who had abducted Bohemia’s beautiful daughter. Cassander’s extraordinary deeds in battle win the day and the daughter, but Cassander modestly declines grateful Bohemia’s offer of his crown and her hand. He departs, having demonstrated that neither wealth nor station interests him.</p>

<p>After many adventures Cassander comes at last to Arcadia, where, among a troop of fair shepherdesses, he sees one whose beauty exceeds Venus’s and whose modesty Diana’s. As she looks at him, she too is affected, and her color comes and goes. Modesty requires the entranced Cassander to depart, but he inquires about her of an aged herdsman. <quote>She is,</quote> he replies, <quote>supposed the daughter of old Thirsis, and she herself doth know no less.</quote> Actually, however, the old man reveals, Thirsis found her as a baby, wrapped in a scarlet mantle and lying in a boat. Because of her astonishing beauty, many men now want her, but she rejects them all.</p>

<p>Cassander’s attempts to persuade himself not to love her are fruitless. Can it be that Cassander the Grecian Conqueror is infatuated with a shepherd’s trull? It can, for Apollo, Mars, and mighty Jove himself have been love’s victims. So Cassander disposes of his steed and his weapons and buys country russet and a flock of sheep, content with his lowly estate if he can but see his love. Unknown to him, his love is equally infatuated and also despairing, for how could such a flock-attending drudge as she hope for a famous knight, one perhaps as false as he is fair?</p>

<p>They meet one day while tending their sheep. Mistaking him for a stranger shepherd, she is so attracted that she quite forgets her love for Cassander. He points out that if she grazes her flock alone, she exposes herself to lions and bears and wolves and many other hazards. He offers to marry her so that she can leave behind the dangers and discomforts of single life. When she demurs, he reveals that he is the knight she recently met who now has set aside his fame and dignity to woo her, because Love levels differences in rank. He is eloquent, and she gives him her hand and heart.</p>

<p>Thirsis, having discovered their intimacy, berates her for loving a stranger who will surely desert her when her beauty fades. Henceforth, he will graze the flock and she will remain at home, out of Cassander’s sight. Cassander is frantic when, rather than Flora, a hostile and uncommunicative Thirsis appears in the fields. Disguised as a beggar, Cassander cries for alms at Thirsis’s door, and Flora recognizes him. She needs immediate help; tomorrow she weds Coridon. Stripping off his disguise, Cassander hurries to the port and arranges passage to Greece. That night he comes for Flora and would have escaped with her undetected had not his horse neighed as they mounted. Awakened, Thirsis pursues them. They manage to board, and Thirsis rages from the shore until Cassander, fearing that his angry words will provoke intervention, forces him into the ship. What is about to happen suddenly strikes Thirsis: he will be taken away from his dear old wife, tossed about on the sea, and finally his bones will lie in some vicious foreign land. He begs to be let go, but the ship puts to sea with him aboard.</p>

<p>Envious Fortune frowns. A storm strikes, the wind and sea go mad, rigging snaps, sails are blown to shreds, the ship splits on the rocks. Cassander tries to rescue Flora, but only he reaches the rock upon which the stone temple stands. Here he has been ever since, sometimes believing that Flora and Thirsis survived, sometimes not, but if he could be reunited with her, his white hairs, bent limbs, and ashen complexion would vanish and his youth would return.</p>

</front>

<body>

<p xml:id="para_0045">Parted from Cassander, Flora and Thirsis are rescued by a passing ship. After visiting the isle of Delphos, they return to the Greek mainland, where they resume their former life.</p>

<p>The poem now looks backward to Flora’s parents. King Palemon of Greece marries the beautiful Julina, a German princess. After the death of his father-in-law, Palemon goes to Germany to claim its crown; he leaves Julina in the care of Eristo, <quote>a grave and senile man,</quote> whose integrity is undoubted. Before long, however, Eristo dotes upon the lovely queen and tries to seduce her. In a rage at her indignant refusal, he writes to Palemon that he has seen Julina playing Venus’s games with Lord Alpinor and that they conspire to murder him and take the crown of Greece. Eristo has Alpinor jailed and murdered, reported a suicide.</p>

<p>Raging, Palemon returns to Greece and, on Eristo’s testimony, condemns Julina to a pitchy dungeon until Apollo or Themis, the goddess of law and justice, confirms her treachery. By this time, Julina is great with child—Alpinor’s, Palemon believes. Alone in her cell, she brings forth a daughter sweet, whom Palemon orders to be set adrift. The queen kisses her little girl, consigns her to the gods’ mercy, and sends with her, wrapped in a robe and a scarlet mantle, a ring, a golden chain, and a purse of golden coins. The wherry boat is thrust off, and the babe floats upon the sea.</p>

<p>At Themis’s temple the Greek peers sent to learn the goddess’s judgment receive a sealed scroll, which they deliver to Palemon. Julina is brought to hear what Palemon is sure will be the goddess’s condemnation of her. Instead the goddess proclaims her chaste and adds that if Destiny helps not, Palemon shall die issueless. The nobles unbind the queen, whom maltreatment has made a pale and grisly ghost, assuring her that Palemon repents. It is too late, however; exhausted with grief, she dies. Palemon’s life becomes perpetual grief.</p>

<p>The baby’s boat makes its way into the Humber, an Arcadian river, where it comes to rest in the bulrushes. Thirsis, a poor hired herdsman, finds the child and the rich things sent with her by the queen. His wife, Mopsa, delighted with their miraculous wealth, agrees to keep their discovery a secret lest the king come and take it all away. She pretends to her neighbors that the baby is her own. Thirsis buys a flock and soon grows rich; Flora, raised to be a shepherdess, grows in beauty and has many suitors, all of whom she scorns.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0060">At this point the plot of <title level="m">The Fissher-mans Tale</title> is summarized and then continued. Cassander lives upon his craggy rock, and Flora and Thirsis, from whom Cassander was separated by the storm, having visited Delos, resume their lives as shepherds in Greece, the land of Flora’s father, Palemon. At length Cassander is rescued by a passing ship and brought to Greece also, where, all unknown to him, Flora has caught the eye of young Dryano, the son of the false Eristo who caused her mother’s death. Thinking to command the love of the shepherd wench, Dryano sends his servant for her, but Flora scornfully rejects the proposition, not only because she is virtuous but also because she knows exactly who Dryano is and what his father did to Queen Julina. Perhaps she should have anticipated Dryano’s response to her rejection of him: he has both Flora and Thirsis brought before the king on judgment day. His curiosity having prompted him also to be present, Cassander hears them accused of treason, condemned on Dryano’s perjured testimony, and sentenced by Palemon to death. Although he does not recognize her, Cassander, heavyhearted, watches as Flora is bound to the stake and Thirsis is hauled to the gibbet. Expecting to die, Thirsis reveals everything—his finding Flora in the boat, the token with her, her elopement with Cassander, his pursuit, the shipwreck and separation from Cassander, their return to Greece. As he listens, Cassander’s frosty locks become golden and his pallid face a healthy red. Palemon’s heart leaps as he recognizes the tokens and his daughter, and on her prompting, he has the villains hanged <quote>before sweet Flora’s face.</quote> Cassander embraces Flora. Even Homer <quote>with his quaint <title level="m">Pernassus</title> verse</quote> could not express half the joys of old Palemon and indeed all the company.</p>

<p>An imprisoned princess, having given birth to a beautiful daughter, entrusts the child to a faithful servant and his wife, who take it to Alexandria.

Because she will marry only a shepherd as she herself is, Florizel adopts shepherd’s garb, in which he woos her. After this, the stories diverge.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hon55"><name type="app">Honigmann</name></ref> (1955, pp. 31–3): <title level="m">WT</title> <quote part="I">may owe more to the novel than the name Florizel.

<p><quote part="M">Manatiles, King of Epirus, had an only son, Arpilior, who loved Princess Galatée. Manatiles also fell in love with Galatée and killed his wife in order to be able to marry her.

There lived at that time <quote xml:lang="fr">vn fort sçauant homme,</quote> a magician who, to calm the king and to save the lovers, <quote xml:lang="fr" xml:id="quote_022">s’auisa de dresser vn ymage si bien ressemblant au jeune Prince, qu’il ne lui restoit que la parole</quote> [<quote type="trans" corresp="#quote_022">decided to have an image made so much like the young prince that only speech was lacking</quote>; cf. <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3108" targetEnd="#tln_3109">3108–9</ref>], and another <quote>image</quote> [effigy, statue] of Galatée. These images were beheaded, the prince, the princess and the king coming at a different hour each day to visit the images, Manatiles thinking Arpilior and Galatée both dead, the prince and princess thinking each other dead, and all of them taking the images to be real corpses. Having paid their visits the prince and princess <quote xml:lang="fr" xml:id="quote_023">s’en retournent chacun en leur prison, ou ils sont secretement nourris, &amp; entent le sage homme que ceey se face tant que le Roi vivra</quote> [<quote type="trans" corresp="#quote_023">each returned to his own prison, where they are secretly fed, and the wise man intends that this continue while the king lives</quote>].</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">This story was told to Florisel and Silvie, who stole into the palace grounds and managed to see the images: <quote xml:lang="fr">contemplerent longuement les cors &amp; les têtes d’icelles ymages, qui se montroyent aussi vermeilles comme si elles eussent été coupees tout fraichement</quote> [for a long time they contemplated the bodies and the heads of those images, which appeared as ruddy as if they had just been cut off; cf. <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3240" targetEnd="#tln_3241">3240–1</ref>]. When Manatiles later visited the images, Florisel and Silvie heard him soliloquise:

<quote rend="block" xml:lang="fr" xml:id="quote_024">O Dieu souverain, ou auoise-ie l’esprit, quand ie permis que telle cruauté fût executee en mon propre enfant.&hellip; Ah amour, que tu es cause de grandes malheurtés &amp; infortunes, ne m’étoit-ce point assés d’auoir m’êchamment meudry ma femme tant preude &amp; chaste, sans me souiller, [<hi rend="italic">32</hi>] &amp; contaminer mes mains de mon sang propre, priuant moy &amp; ce tant riche Royaume de legitime heritier?</quote>

Cf. <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2733" targetEnd="#tln_2739">2733–9</ref> ff.]</quote>

Manatiles decided, however, that repentance was foolish, and thought that the <quote>execution</quote> of the two lovers was an act of justice.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">When Galatée came to visit the image of Arpilior, Silvie told her that she had been enchanted, and convinced her that the image was not a real body. Florisel, Silvie and Galatée then waited for the real Arpilior to appear. When he arrived, Galatée ran to meet him,

<quote rend="block"><foreign xml:lang="fr">&amp; se ietta à son col, le tenant long tems embrassé sans pouvoir faire autre chose que pleurer &amp; soûpirer profondement de grand joye qu’elle auoyt</foreign> [and threw her arms about his neck, holding him for a long time unable to do anything but weep and sigh profoundly because of the great joy she felt; cf. <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3322">3322</ref>].</quote>

Arpilior, however, stood bewildered, forcing Galatée to exclaim: <quote xml:lang="fr">ne soyés plus abusé d’vne statuë composee par art magique &amp; deceptif, voyés la viue image de vôtre amye</quote> [don’t be deluded any longer by a statue made by deceptive magic; see the living image of your love].

Later Florisel killed Manatiles, Arpilior married Galatée, and the magician was rewarded for preserving them.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">Lastly the magician threw a spell on the garden in which the images had been kept, filling it with statues of the heroes and heroines of the Amadis stories. Florisel entered the magic garden and was overjoyed to see the statues

<quote rend="block"><foreign xml:lang="fr">&amp; pensa par plusieurs fois monter sus le trône, pour les aller embrasser, estimant que ce n’étoyt faintise ni enchantement, ains chose vraye</foreign> [and thought several times to mount the throne in order to embrace them, believing that this was neither fantasy nor enchantment but the real thing; cf. <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3280" targetEnd="#tln_3281">3280–1</ref>].</quote></quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">At first sight the resemblances to <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> are not very startling. Manatiles, a jealous tyrant, kills his wife and tries to kill his only child and heir. The heir (Arpilior) is miraculously preserved by the friendly magician (who corresponds to Paulina in <title level="m">Winter’s Tale</title>); and so on. It is the magician’s use of statues, and specifically Arpilior’s reactions when he finds that Galatée is really alive, which seems to have the more immediate bearing on <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>. The repetition that Paulina can make the statue move <hi rend="italic">by magic</hi>—[<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3230">3230</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3293" targetEnd="#tln_3295">3293–5</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3302" targetEnd="#tln_3303">3302–3</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3319">3319</ref>]—could be partly due to the fact that Paulina’s role may be modelled on that of the magician. Similarly the statement that Paulina [<quote>hath priuately, twice or thrice a day, euer since the death of <name rend="italic">Hermione</name>, visited that remoued House</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3113" targetEnd="#tln_3114">3113–14</ref>)], the <quote>house</quote> being her own home [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3192">3192</ref>], seems less peculiar—why should the wife of a nobleman live in a <quote>removed house</quote>, and <quote>visit</quote> her own home?—when we recall that the magician kept Arpilior and Galatée secretly in prisons.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">33</hi>] If Shakespeare took the name Florisel from [<title level="m">Amadis</title> 9] there is some likelihood that he had met with Arpilior and Galatée.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">Besides the possibility that <quote xml:lang="es">la bella Perdida</quote> suggested <quote>Perdita</quote> to Shakespeare, as Browne believed [see above, <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0015"/>], a prophecy quoted in the chapter immediately following the end of Manatiles [9:22] could have had the same result:

<quote rend="block"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Quiconques cherchera Armide, peut entrer franchement, mais la saillie a deus extrêmes de la gaigner ou pedre, iusques à ce que les perdus soyent trouués par la perduë</foreign> [Whoever will seek Armide may enter freely, but the undertaking has two extremes of gain or loss, until the lost things are found by the lost one].</quote>

Here there is an arresting resemblance to [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1315" targetEnd="#tln_1316">1315–16</ref>], which Shakespeare transcribed from <title level="m">Pandosto</title> [see <ptr targType="quote" target="#quote_001"/>].

<p>Honigmann’s argument may have been unknown to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj70"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref> (1970, p. 158): <quote>There is not a shred of evidence that Shakespeare ever read so much as a book of <title level="m">Amadis</title></quote>; any apparent influence was derived through <title level="m">Pandosto</title> (see also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ocoj70"><name type="app">O’Connor</name></ref>, p. 214).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg75"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1975, 8:119–22) believes that in addition to <title level="m">Amadis</title>, Greene—hence Sh. indirectly—was influenced by another popular romance, <title level="m">The Mirrour of Knighthood</title>. The complete <title level="m">Mirrour</title> consists of four parts: part 1 (3 books) was written by Diego Ortuñez de Calahorra; part 2 (2 books), by Pedro de la Sierra; and parts 3 and 4 (2 books each), by Marcos Martinez.

Eighteen years later, the two are in love, but before they are betrothed, Esmoreit wants to discover who he is.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_llow1813"><name type="app">Lloyd</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_sing2"><name type="app">Singer</name></ref>, ed. 1856, 4:131–3): <quote part="I">The Alcestis of Euripides, both in treatment and incident, has many points of analogy with The Winter’s Tale.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">132</hi>] The ancient critics noted it [<title level="m">Alcestis</title>] as partaking rather of comedy than tragedy, as it starts from trouble and misfortune, and concludes with general satisfaction; and having regard to the tenor of some portions, the proper effect of comedy was thought to approximate to the satirick tone. Admetus, fated to die, is by favour of Apollo permitted to prolong his life by furnishing Death with a voluntary substitute. He urges the duty upon his aged parents, who repudiate the proposal with very marked reflections on its unreasonableness, and on his coolness in the proposition, but they fail to bring home to him this view of his conduct; and when his wife Alcestis becomes the volunteer, he grieves her fate as he would at an inevitable blow, is inconsolable at his bereavement, would fain accompany her, but, wrapped up in blind selfishness, never once contrasts her conduct, which he so much admires, with his own. His position is placed before him most forcibly by his father, but he can only see his father’s selfishness not his own, and drives on in dark obstinacy upon the path that must end in his being undeceived to humiliation the most degrading.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="M">No word of reproach passes the lips of Alcestis; but her parting appeal to him, to spare her children the unhappiness of a stepmother, speaks expressively. If she says a word to set forth her sacrifice and the contrast of her self-devotion to the coldness of others, it is to urge a claim to this consideration for those she leaves behind, and she places them solemnly in his hands upon formal declaration of the stipulation. There is no mistaking in the comparative coldness of her adieu to him, a sense of the forfeiture he has incurred of that respect without which love lives not. She dies on the stage like Hermione, and her sorrowing husband forthwith prepares her solemn funeral, rejecting his father’s contribution, as he regards him as the impersonation of cowardice and selfishness. It is when he returns from the entombment, and stands before the doors of his widowed household, that his nobler heart recovers, and he passionately avows that too late he learns his wife has the nobler and better fate; he has forfeited happiness and fame together, his dwelling must henceforth be unbearable, and elsewhere he can only hope for the vituperation he utterly deserves. The Chorus comfort him, and urge the reparation of funeral honour. In the meanwhile Hercules brings back Alcestis veiled, rescued by his arm from the already closed clutches of Thanatos, hateful to God and man. Hercules pretends that his companion is a prize won in games, and offering to leave her with Admetus and even referring to renewed wedlock, draws from him expressions soothing to his [<hi rend="italic">133</hi>] revived queen, as those that Paulina draws from the penitent Leontes. Yet, like Leontes gazing at the statue, he looks till the force of resemblance raises him to the highest pitch of agitation. At length, by gradation like that in Shakespeare’s play, the form of his wife in unveiled, and he recognizes her and falls on her neck. But she stands speechless; the purifications due to the infernal gods must first be performed, and a three days’ interval elapse before he may hear her voice; and thus in her silent presence the play concludes.</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">The elevated dignity and majesty thus expressed in the figure of Alcestis, the vindication of the self-devoted womanhood from the selfish neglect of a stronger power but an inferior nature is admirably realized, and is parallel to the reparation accorded to Hermione, who suffers with dignity as well as patience, and preserves herself not from consideration for a husband who has forfeited his nobler title, but for the sake of a daughter lost, but promised by the oracle to be found. The silence of Alcestis is not more satisfactory and expressive than the circumstance that, in the single short speech of Hermione, her words recognize and address alone her recovered daughter. She extends her hand to Leontes, and when he embraces her in joyful astonishment, full forgiveness is sealed by her frank embrace and entire reconciliation. <quote>She hangs upon [sic] his neck</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3322">3322</ref>]; but it is when the recovered Perdita kneels that her mother’s voice is heard again, and then, as if in the same awe of the powers of death from whom Hermione and Perdita seem, like Alcestis, to have been recovered, the scene hastily closes and the play is at an end.</quote></p>

The suggestion of the body without the soul is plain. Leontes and Admetos, too, are both to be tempted to disregard an overweening sorrow for their wives, and the voice of accusing impurity they recognize is to be overwhelmed, so that they may love again&hellip;for the good of the state.&hellip; Paulina is the Herakles of <quote>The Winter’s Tale</quote>, and she scourges Leontes to his honor, till he says [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2792" targetEnd="#tln_2796">2792–6</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2808" targetEnd="#tln_2809">2808–9</ref>].

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dri60"><name type="app">Driver</name></ref> (1960, pp. 197–8): <quote>If Euripides thought Admetus possessed any internal guilt, he did not dramatize it.

The only internalization is that of the feelings in a situation from which there seems to be no escape. The state of Admetus and Alcestis at the end is therefore not essentially different from that at the beginning. They are released <hi rend="italic">from</hi> an imprisonment, but they are not reconciled <hi rend="italic">to</hi> anything. This means there is an inherent balance in the [<hi rend="italic">198</hi>] work, of which the highly theatrical <foreign xml:lang="grk-latn" rend="italic">agons</foreign> with their frequent use of stichomythia are excellent expressions.&hellip; However much we may enjoy it technically or because of its emotion, it can never represent to us what the tragi-comedies of Shakespeare do, which utilize the forms of the stage to body forth the images of man’s internal history, with its furor, its disseverances, and its reconciliation.</quote></p>

A marriage is arranged between Felisardo and the daughter of the Admiral, but the young prince will not listen to it, and, on the advice of his merry servant, Tristan, feigns himself in love with a marble statue in the garden, and to such an extreme did he carry this feigned fascination that at last, to save him from dropping into his tomb, the King consented that he should wed the statue.

<head>Shakespeare’s Plays</head>

<p>Similarities between aspects of <title level="m">WT</title> and Sh.’s earlier plays have frequently been noted—for example, by <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pen2"><name type="app">Schanzer</name></ref> (ed. 1969, pp. 12–13): <quote part="I">In dramatizing the <quote>resurrection</quote> of Hermione, he [Sh.] evidently drew on memories of two of his own previous plays, <title level="m">Much Ado About Nothing</title> and <title level="m">Pericles</title>. The plot-parallels between <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> and <title level="m">Much Ado About Nothing</title> are the more extensive: in both plays the husband (or bridegroom) publicly accuses his wife (or bride) of unchastity; she falls into a swoon and is believed to be dead by all who are present; but she recovers, and is secretly hidden away, while her husband (or bridegroom) continues to believe her to be dead. He discovers her innocence, repents of his actions, devises an epitaph for her tomb setting forth the cause of her death, and vows to visit that tomb as an act of penance (daily in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>, once a year in <title level="m">Much Ado About Nothing</title>). He promises—and here Shakespeare drew on memories of Bandello’s <hi rend="italic">novella</hi> [22 (1554)], his source for <title level="m">Much Ado About Nothing</title>, [<hi rend="italic">13</hi>] rather than on the play itself—that when he marries again he will only take a wife chosen for him (by the slandered woman’s father in the one case, her friend in the other). One further hint Shakespeare may have derived from the <hi rend="italic">novella</hi>. Describing the slandered woman lying in her swoon, Bandello remarks that she resembled a marble statue rather than a live woman. This may have suggested the idea of making Hermione pose as her own statue.&hellip;</quote></p>

<p><quote part="F">In the shaping of the statue-scene memories of the finale of <title level="m">Pericles</title> played a major part. In both plays a queen is believed to be dead.&hellip; But she returns to life and remains in seclusion for many years.&hellip; The final scene depicts her reunion, after this long gap of time, with husband and daughter, who had both firmly believed her to be dead. In both plays this scene breathes a similar atmosphere of ceremonious solemnity turning to wonder and joy; in both the daughter kneels before her mother, who calls her <quote>my own.</quote></quote></p>

It is no reflection on Greene to say that his novel cannot live with such romances as these; for they are in intention and performance the profoundest and most serious art of the period.&hellip; They nevertheless use romantic themes.

<p>This good-natured heroical-pastoral romance was first mentioned in a Stationers’ Register entry dated 29 November (for December?) 1653. It was published in 1661 by the piratical Francis Kirkman; the quarto title page gives the authors as John Webster and William Rowley, an attribution rejected by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_har64"><name type="app">Harbage</name></ref> et al.

The date was taken to be in the 1590s. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hat08"><name type="app">Hatcher</name></ref> (1908), however, argues that, in addition to <title level="m">Menaphon</title>, <title level="m">The Thracian Wonder</title> was influenced by other works by Greene such as <title level="m">Orlando Furioso</title> and <title level="m">James the Fourth</title>; he finds that it (p. 19) <quote>belong[s]&hellip;somewhere between 1600 and 1610.</quote> Still, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hat08"><name type="app">Hatcher</name></ref>, like his predecessors, stops short of making it a source of <title level="m">WT</title>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cru71"><name type="app">Crupi</name></ref> (1971, p. 347), in fact, believes that <title level="m">The Thracian Wonder</title> is indebted to <title level="m">WT</title>, <quote>which would place <title level="m">The Thracian Wonder</title> after 1611.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_marj08"><name type="app">Marks</name></ref> (1908, pp. 48–9) summarizes the plot of <title level="m">The Thracian Wonder</title>: <quote>Ariadne, daughter to King Pheander, has clandestinely married Radagon, who is disguised as a menial at the court of Pheander, and is King of <quote>Scicillia</quote>. When the marriage is disclosed, the maiden’s father at once begins a course of the most tyrannical cruelty. He banishes Ariadne and the little son Eusanius, putting them to sea in a boat; he then proceeds to banish Radagon in the same fashion. Finally, he exiles his own brother Sophos for pleading the cause of Ariadne. As a punishment for the King’s sins, a terrible plague attacks the court, an oracle revealing that until the monarch makes retribution, the country shall know neither peace nor prosperity. Overcome with remorse, Pheander goes out as a pilgrim seeking Ariadne. In the mean time the daughter and her little son and Radagon have [<hi rend="italic">49</hi>] come to shore; Radagon and Ariadne, although mutually attracted, do not recognize each other. In the end a recognition takes place, they are discovered by Pheander, and all return happily homeward.</quote> She adds (pp. 49–50): <quote>Some of the scenes bespeak at least a smattering of a knowledge of classical idyls [sic], for the pastoral quality is at times closely imitated. The [<hi rend="italic">50</hi>] mythological ingredients are further borne out by the appearance of the Goddess Pithia and of a Chorus and <quote>Time</quote>. Titterus and Pallemon and a Clown afford the merry element, and very merry and full of coarse jests they are. There is, too, a fisherman among the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">dramatis personæ</foreign>, an interesting <quote>pastoral-piscatory</quote> touch, and also the usual religious accompaniment of the pastoral play, <hi rend="italic">a priest</hi>.</quote></p>

<p>Despite the extraordinary regard usually expressed for Sh.’s work, the critical reception of <title level="m">WT</title> reminds us that for particular plays the delight of one critic is often the displeasure of another.</p>

<p>A few critics voice outright disapproval. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dry1672"><name type="app">Dryden</name></ref> (1672; 1978, 11:206): The play is <quote>either grounded on impossibilities, or at least, so meanly written, that the Comedy neither caus’d your mirth, nor the serious part your concernment.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_len1753"><name type="app">Lennox</name></ref> (1753, 2:75): <quote>If we compare the Conduct of the incidents in [<title level="m">WT</title>] with the paltry Story on which it is founded, we shall find the Original much less absurd and ridiculous.

<p>Critics discuss <title level="m">WT</title>’s use of the features of one genre or another without actually placing it wholly in any, because it is a hybrid, borrowing from many genres without belonging primarily to one.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0066"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mez1882"><name type="app">Mézières</name></ref> (1860; 1882, p. 518): Although <title level="m">WT</title> is not pastoral, comedy, or tragedy, Sh. <quote>touches on all three genres, rather than fixing on one, [to produce]&hellip;a rapid sketch of three kinds, none of which is perfect.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_halh1871"><name type="app">Hall</name></ref> (1871, p. 245), however: <title level="m">WT</title> may <quote>truly be termed a tragic-comic pastoral, for the oracle of Delphi decides the tragic catastrophe and prepares the reader for the happy conclusion of the piece.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gerg1877"><name type="app">Gervinus</name></ref> (1849–50; 1863, 2:469) agrees. Like <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ris10"><name type="app">Ristine</name></ref> (1910, p. 113), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adaj23"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1923, p. 417) calls <title level="m">WT</title> a tragicomedy embodying, as its title suggests, the qualities of a romance. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ker54"><name type="app">Kermode</name></ref> (ed. <title level="m">Tmp.</title>, 1954, p. lix): <quote>The pastoral romance gave [Sh.] the opportunity for a very complex comparison between the worlds of Art and Nature; and the tragicomic form enabled him to concentrate the whole story of apparent disaster, penitence, and forgiveness into one happy misfortune, controlled by a divine Art.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ker63"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1963, p. xxiv): The last plays <quote>could well be called Romantic tragicomedies.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ben64"><name type="app">Bentley</name></ref> (1964, p. 94) suggests romances, tragicomedies, <quote>or simply the plays of the fourth period.</quote> To <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_vel72"><name type="app">Velie</name></ref> (1972, pp. 61, 91, 112–13), the combining of <quote>the happy ending of comedy with the serious tone and action of tragedy</quote> produces <quote>elements of melodrama,</quote> which Sh. makes sophisticated through (p. 91) his rigorous psychological examination of Leontes and (p. 112) an ending that does not resurrect Antigonus and Mamillius. Sh. combines (p. 113) <quote>psychological realism, complication comedy, and romance</quote> to achieve a <quote>dramatic form that is excellently suited to convey the theme of repentance.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kri82"><name type="app">Krier</name></ref> (1982, pp. 343–4), however: <title level="m">WT</title> gives us <quote>a complete and highly compressed tragedy, with deaths and a sea of blood,</quote> with <quote>real evil, not the appearance of it only,</quote> and with <quote>real, far-reaching and ruinous</quote> consequences. <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>gives us enough tragic catastrophes in three acts&hellip;for a full tragedy.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">344</hi>] Yet it is precisely at this nadir that Shakespeare chooses to make a comedy of the play.&hellip; The switch in tone is certainly unexpected.&hellip; But comedy here is allowed to be as dominant a tone as tragedy is.&hellip; [Both] are sustained in the play as a paradox of two apparently incompatible genres&hellip;which do in reality exist together, unblended, each with its characteristic atmosphere.</quote></p>

<p>A few critics offer singular notions of genre. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hugf1868"><name type="app">Hugo</name></ref> (1868, 4:38): From its earliest publication this play has been the subject of a mistake; placed by the editors of [<siglum>F1</siglum>] in the list of Comedies, it has been accepted according to its label, and held to be&hellip;a light and fanciful improvisation.&hellip; [<title level="m">WT</title>] is no comedy; it is a tragedy.&hellip; It is so by its general composition, by its impassioned tone, and by the ascending scale of its chief scenes (in Fr.). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilj67"><name type="app">Williams</name></ref> (1967, p. 19): The <quote>abstract form [of Time, the Chorus] harks back to the morality plays.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_win50"><name type="app">Wincor</name></ref> (1950, pp. 219–26) vacillates: <title level="m">WT</title> may derive from <quote>the old festival plays that celebrate the return of spring after a barren winter</quote> in drama that grows (p. 220) <quote>out of seasonal rites and worship.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">226</hi>] If Shakespeare did not conceive this as a festival play, he at least was conscious of working in terms of allegorical winter and spring.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hoy73"><name type="app">Hoy</name></ref> (1973, pp. 64–5): <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>may be said to come into its own on the Jacobean stage with the advent of tragi-comedy, which is the mannerist dramatic form par excellence.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">65</hi>] The mannerist features of [<title level="m">WT</title>] are particularly prominent. The process of temporal foreshortening, whereby Leontes’ jealousy&hellip;is full grown within the space of some sixty lines, is as violent as any spatial foreshadowing in Tintoretto. The Chorus of Time&hellip;fulfills its purpose by the familiar mannerist device of directly signalling to the audience</quote>; omitting Perdita’s recognition scene (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3010" targetEnd="#tln_3100">3010–100</ref>) <quote>has its analogy in the tendency in mannerist painting to relegate the principal scene or figure from the foreground or centre to the background or side,</quote> and the statue scene reveals the <quote>mannerist fondness for securing bizarre and somewhat equivocal effects from mixing figures on pedestals with living figures.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_thok71"><name type="app">Thompson</name></ref> (1971, pp. 154–5): <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>may be regarded as the final romanticization of revenge tragedy,</quote> in which the hero <quote>searches for a cause and interprets all evidence in light of his own belief that his honor has been besmirched. He then fancies himself free to plot, threaten, devise punishments, and ensnare his enemies, all in the name of [<hi rend="italic">155</hi>] his cherished honor.</quote> But (p. 156) tragedy is countered and revenge purged <quote>by employing romantic conventions to unravel the plot.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_harj78"><name type="app">Hartwig</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_harj78"><name type="app">Kay</name> &amp; <name type="app">Jacobs</name></ref>, 1978, pp. 98–101): Sh. <quote>experiment[s] with the possibilities of parody</quote> by substituting an onstage Autolycus for the absent Leontes.

<p>A number of critics associate <title level="m">WT</title> with allegory or emblem. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_har61"><name type="app">Harbage</name></ref> (1961, p. 442): The <quote>exchange of banter [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_121" targetEnd="#tln_152">121–52</ref>]</quote> between Hermione and Polixenes is, <quote>through imagery and allusion, an allegory of the fall of Man, a commentary upon <rs type="bibleref"><hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi>, 3:1–5</rs></quote>; though <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mui69"><name type="app">Muir</name></ref> (1969, p. 101) asserts that Sh. <quote>never indulged in allegory as such,</quote> he acknowledges allegorical and emblematic <quote>undertones</quote> in the play. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hoe50"><name type="app">Hoeniger</name></ref> (1950, pp. 13–15): The <quote>whole tone of the play with its repeated allusion to supernatural forces and its at times unearthly serenity</quote> suggests allegory, in which (p. 14) the precise meaning of words depends on speaker as well as listener. <quote>It then follows that if the poet desires to convey a profound vision of reality, he will seek to break away from&hellip;words which have become chained.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">15</hi>] Therefore [allegory] is one of the most poetic forms of speech, for in it words are loaded with the greatest possible symbolic suggestion. It is not surprising, then, if a great poet resorts to allegory to express his vision.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nut66"><name type="app">Nuttall</name></ref> (1966, p. 38) calls Time an <quote>unashamedly allegorical figure who has stepped out of an altogether older type of drama,</quote> while <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sall66"><name type="app">Salingar</name></ref> (1966, p. 3) notes Time’s <quote>emblematic function, bringing out the significance of the action he foreshadows.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mahm92"><name type="app">Mahood</name></ref> (1992, p. 35): Time is an <quote>allegorical abstraction who is at once outside the action and, by his very nature, operative within it&hellip;[since] all events under the sun are the products of Time.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clu72"><name type="app">Clubb</name></ref> (1972, pp. 24–6): <quote>Traditionally, as a fact of natural history, as literary subject, and as simile, the bear, unformed [at birth, to be licked into shape by its mother], and therefore potentially tragic or comic, must have seemed almost emblematically appropriate</quote> to <title level="m">WT</title> in suggesting that (p. 26) <quote>human nature [is] primitive but promising, somewhat amenable to refining influences</quote> or, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hardc85"><name type="app">Hardman</name></ref> (1985, p. 233) would have it, in suggesting the <quote>superiority of art over nature.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wic73"><name type="app">Wickham</name></ref> (1973, pp. 97–8): In <quote>an emblem&hellip;both narrative and characters need do no more than reflect a particular situation.&hellip; [<title level="m">WT</title>] reflects the surprising, if not miraculous, reunification of the British Isles in the person of the heir-apparent, Prince Henry</quote> (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0016"/>).

These meanings are not logically compatible. But then, [the play] is not [<hi rend="italic">42</hi>] simple allegory.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">49</hi>] The last three acts of [<title level="m">WT</title>] are allegorical romance&hellip;[and] in such a form, continuity sometimes depends entirely on the&hellip;allegory.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gra86"><name type="app">Grantley</name></ref> (1986, pp. 19–36): Emblematic characterization in <title level="m">WT</title> devolves from the foregrounded <quote>moral dichotomy producing choice and/or conflict</quote> in medieval allegorical drama and its successor, the Tudor interlude. In Leontes we see (p. 21) <quote>the corrupting process of life and the necessity for spiritual rebirth,</quote> in Paulina (p. 26), Leontes’s conscience, and in Autolycus (p. 26), something of the Vice, though Sh. was attempting neither a (p. 36) <quote>straightforward moral allegory</quote> of the fall and redemption of man, nor a 17th-c. <quote>version of earlier scriptural plays.</quote> Rather, he draws on themes central to the religious drama of his youth and <quote>traditional images of enormous dramatic and mythic power&hellip;[which] effectively constitute the tradition of which [<title level="m">WT</title>] can be regarded as part.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_davc82"><name type="app">Davidson</name></ref> (1982, pp. 73–83), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fab84"><name type="app">Fabiny</name></ref> (1984, pp. 89–92), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_iwa84"><name type="app">Iwasaki</name></ref> (1984, pp. 68–71, 90) also consider the play emblematic.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wig1884"><name type="app">Wigston</name></ref> ([1884], p. 12) observes that Time as Chorus <quote>points to something serious, and beyond the mere surface of the play</quote>—nothing less, according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_walg70"><name type="app">Waller</name></ref> (1970, p. 135), than the <quote>thematic justification of the play’s intention and meaning.&hellip; Time is established as the medium of all human growth and fulfillment, and the play itself is now seen as the unfolding of events by Father Time himself.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cos77"><name type="app">Cosgrove</name></ref> (1977, p. 178) also makes this point. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ewb64"><name type="app">Ewbank</name></ref> (1964, p. 84): Sh. <quote>makes the Triumph of Time into a controlling theme of his tale; in doing so he transforms what the conventional motto suggests—a simple victory of Time, the Father of Truth—into a dramatic exploration of the manifold meanings of Time,</quote> one of which critics like <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ker63"><name type="app">Kermode</name></ref> (ed. 1963, pp. xxvi–xxvii) find in the juxtaposition of <quote>Time as destroyer and renewer, that which ruins the work of men but is the father of truth,&hellip;[and that which seems] aimlessly destructive&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">xxvii</hi>] but is in the end seen to be <quote>merciful</quote> because it finally&hellip;must renew truth.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_youd72"><name type="app">Young</name></ref> (1972, p. 134) agrees: Sh. makes linear time the irrevocable <quote>enemy to human aspirations,</quote> cyclical time a restorative <quote>in harmony with man’s hopes.</quote></p>

<p>A number of critics find greater significance in the way Time connects the world of the audience to the world onstage. <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cln2"><name type="app">Bethell</name></ref> (ed. 1956, p. 25) notes that one theme of the play juxtaposes <quote>various <quote>planes of reality</quote></quote>—the timeless imaginative world of the play as seen against the real world of time, for example. <quote>Time tells us that even <quote>this present</quote>—the <hi rend="italic">now</hi> of the audience—will itself become an old tale: our own lives are given the same degree of reality or unreality as the tale of Leontes, and only Time is timeless.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_felh72"><name type="app">Felperin</name></ref> (1972, pp. 227, 230): <quote>The natural cycles of birth, death, and rebirth&hellip;are existentially realized on stage.&hellip; The seasons change in the world of this play just as they do in the real world.&hellip; The imagery faithfully reflects not only the world outside the play but the world inside the play as well.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">230</hi>] By soliciting our imaginative cooperation in the dramatic process&hellip;the Chorus of Time also works to make us aware of the play as a play.&hellip; Time mediates between the worlds of life and art and plays upon our sense of their separateness and their continuity, their dissimilarity and their resemblance. He reminds us, that is, that his powers of destruction and recreation (his speech [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1580" targetEnd="#tln_1611">1580–1611</ref>] is the apotheosis of the play’s imagery of natural process) extend beyond the play world into the real world, and that the principals [of the play] are subject to the same laws as we.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dea79"><name type="app">Dean</name></ref> (1979, pp. 252–4) finds in Time’s appearance <quote>one of the most serious moments in the play—for <hi rend="italic">our</hi> ruler is speaking, the ruler of nature and art.&hellip; We are entertained and informed by a power we are subject to in the very moment we watch its ingratiating performance.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">253</hi>] We are forced to recognize the ineluctable motions governing life,&hellip;the common process&hellip;in which both audience and actors grow fresh and wax stale.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">254</hi>] Time’s appearance in [<title level="m">WT</title>] brings out the idea of an entity which is both ruthless and ceaseless, pleasing and informative.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_garn85"><name type="app">Garner</name></ref> (1985, pp. 347–50) concurs: <quote>In drama, time is a theme by necessity, for in the medium of performance it stands as an inescapable backdrop to dramatic action, as well as a fundamental condition of theatrical life.</quote> Sh.’s (p. 349) investigation of the relationship between the present and its temporal contexts extends to (p. 350) <quote>his audience’s temporal experience of the play in performance.</quote></p>

<p>Some critics think the theme of Time the destroyer predominates. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_trad68"><name type="app">Traversi</name></ref> (1969, 2:300): <quote>The action of time, as seen at this stage of the play [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_124" targetEnd="#tln_145">124–45</ref>], is a corrupting action; experience, as it enters into the life of innocence, destroys the foundations of spontaneous friendship.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_org1996"><name type="app">Orgel</name></ref> (ed. 1996, p. 17) is less restrictive: <title level="m">WT</title>’s <quote>realities are not the facts of history but the terrifying truths of the inner life—the destructiveness of jealousy, the creations of sexual fear, the complexities of love, the imponderable unpredictability of family relationships and deep, long-lasting friendships, the divided loyalties inherent in even the most devoted service. The insistent theme is time; but a time removed from history and located within the family, time as defined by generations, by youth and age, by the relations between parents and children, and by the blood-brotherhood of male bonding starting in early childhood.</quote> Like <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_holn64"><name type="app">Holland</name></ref> (1964, p. 291), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_edwp68"><name type="app">Edwards</name></ref> (1968, pp. 148–9) sees as meaningful Sh.’s suggestion of <quote>the inevitable decay of whatever is fresh and new. If spring comes, can winter be far behind? When Time enters as Chorus, he is not only a device to bridge a long gap in the narrative [<hi rend="italic">149</hi>] of the story: he is inexorable time, whose hand is upon Perdita and Florizel.</quote> Yet <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_linp86"><name type="app">Lindenbaum</name></ref> (1986, pp. 126–7) concludes: [<title level="m">WT</title>] is <quote>a celebration of life&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">127</hi>] as it exists in&hellip;a world governed by time. It is Shakespeare’s considerable achievement in this play&hellip;that he can bring us to accept the view of time as constantly moving forward and hence eroding and destructive, and to accept it not merely with resignation but with equanimity and even enthusiasm.</quote></p>

<p>Other critics, including <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_art64"><name type="app">Arthos</name></ref> (1964, p. 161), assert that the main point of the play is <quote>the power of time to redeem.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_smim66"><name type="app">Smith</name></ref> (1966, p. 46): <quote>Time changes all things, but it is the regenerative rather than the destructive aspects of mutability which are stressed.

<head>Nature (and Art)</head>

<p>For a few critics—<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lea42"><name type="app">Leavis</name></ref> (1942, p. 345) is one—the Nature which gives <quote>depth and richness of significance</quote> to the play is equated with <quote>nature at large,</quote> a force associated with <quote>the concrete presence of time in its rhythmic processes</quote> and all forms of <quote>growth, decay and rebirth.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hil79"><name type="app">Hillman</name></ref> (1979, pp. 16–17): Perdita’s flowers symbolize <quote>the richness and beauty of nature’s creations, on the one hand, their fragility and transience on the other.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] She shows herself highly conscious of the changing seasons</quote> (and mortality), but she counters <quote>by affirming life and love&hellip;in a way which implies that death, too, is a part of nature and that love can flourish in its shadow.</quote> Some critics also recognize, with <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fryn62"><name type="app">Frye</name></ref> (1962, p. 246), that <quote>nature is associated, not with the credible, but with the incredible: nature as an order is subordinated to the nature that yearly confronts us with the impossible miracle of renewed life,</quote> in the (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fryn65b"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref>, <quote>Nature,</quote> 1965, p. 56) <quote>world of higher nature which romance approaches,</quote> a world <quote>not of time but of the fulfillment of time.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kni47"><name type="app">Knight</name></ref> (1947; 1966, pp. 90–1): <quote>Nature rules our play</quote> and is <quote>responsible for the miraculous perpetuation and re-creation of worn and sinful man.</quote> The miraculous can have (p. 91) <quote>Christian impact,</quote> though the <quote>natural majesty explored is also in part Hellenic.</quote> In the play’s descriptions of Nature, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sen50"><name type="app">Sen Gupta</name></ref> (1950, p. 223) discerns <quote>the workings of a superhuman agency from whom proceed life and beauty</quote>; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bus56"><name type="app">Bush</name></ref> (1956, pp. 130–2) sees a Nature that is <quote>the source of life and love, a seen and unseen lesson in goodness, and a creator of innocence and bounty—a perfect image, undoubted, unconfined and unquestioned.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">132</hi>] Nature and art are gentle rivals in the creation of the beautiful and wonderful, but art can never match the miracle of natural things.</quote> For additional criticism, see <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_pen2"><name type="app">Schanzer</name></ref> (ed. 1969, pp. 36–8), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nica52"><name type="app">Nicoll</name></ref> (1952, pp. 171–2), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hol64"><name type="app">Holbrook</name></ref> (1964, pp. 134–5), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wilj67"><name type="app">Williams</name></ref> (1967, pp. 21–38).</p>

<p>Of more particular significance is the critics’ identification of, first, the Perdita-Polixenes debate over gardening [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1887" targetEnd="#tln_1921">1887–1921</ref>] and, second, the statue scene [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3183">3183</ref> ff.] as the primary loci of <title level="m">WT</title>’s juxtaposition of nature and art. Examining and taking up Perdita’s side, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cooh77"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref> (1977, p. 141) reminds us that since the demise of the <quote>Golden Age&hellip;[the] life of pure Nature was damaged by the invention of arts, of building, of commerce.</quote> Thus when Perdita rejects grafting, <quote>she is insisting on the integrity of Nature before the <quote>improving</quote> influences of Art.

<p>Other critics assume a position that transcends both Perdita’s and Polixenes’s. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kni47"><name type="app">Knight</name></ref> (1947; 1966, p. 105): The speakers are <quote>at cross purposes, since one is referring to art, the other to artificiality.&hellip; Human civilization, art and religion are clearly in one sense part of <quote>great creating nature</quote>, and so is everything else.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_trad55"><name type="app">Traversi</name></ref> (1955, pp. 106–7) suggests a four-part division, a <quote>beautifully balanced construction,</quote> analogous to four musical movements.

<p>Several other unique views of structure are explored. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dri60"><name type="app">Driver</name></ref> (1960, pp. 181–3): <quote>The pattern is circular, with the pastoral scenes enveloped by those of court life.

<p>Perdita’s verse evokes a similar reaction. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hune54"><name type="app">Hunter</name></ref> (1954, p. 286): We see in her <quote>unmistakably the quality of a princess</quote> because Sh. <quote>has written into her speech a most remarkable expression of her personality.

<p>Time’s language and style get almost as much attention as Leontes’s language does. Many critics find the speech (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1580" targetEnd="#tln_1611">1580–1611</ref>) inferior. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rid38"><name type="app">Ridley</name></ref> (1937, p. 208): <quote>One hopes not Shakespeare’s.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_wh1"><name type="app">White</name></ref> (ed. 1857, 5:397): <quote>There could hardly be a greater difference in style than that between Time’s speech as Chorus and the rest of the verse in this play. The former is direct, simple, composed of the commonest words used in their commonest signification, but bald and tame, and in its versification very constrained and ungraceful: the latter is involved, parenthetical, having a vocabulary of its own, but rich in beauties of thought and expression, and entirely untrammelled by the form in which it is written.&hellip; The Chorus I believe not to have been written by Shakespeare.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_rol1879"><name type="app">Rolfe</name></ref> (ed. 1879, p. 181) rejects it because <quote>not only the style of the speech, but its being in rhyme, may lead us to doubt whether S. wrote it.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_hud2"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (ed. 1880, 7:282): <quote>The authorship&hellip;is, to say the least, exceedingly doubtful.&hellip; The workmanship is at once clumsy, languid, and obscure.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grew55"><name type="app">Greg</name></ref> (1955, p. 417), however: <quote>It is no great achievement&hellip;but not all readers will agree with [Wilson’s] denigration of the style or refuse to find in it some Shakespearian turns of phrase.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sta1880"><name type="app">Stapfer</name></ref> (1879; 1880, p. 60) does: <quote>It would be impossible to speak in a quieter and prouder tone than this, and nothing is more striking in Time’s speech than its dignified calmness and serenity.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_kit1"><name type="app">Kittredge</name></ref> (ed. 1936, p. 432): Time <quote>should speak in character.

It acts as a bridge, gives information, and distinguishes Time from the other characters.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tur71"><name type="app">Turner</name></ref> (1971, pp. 147–9): <quote>Time’s speech <hi rend="italic">is</hi> obscure.&hellip; It is very difficult to get anything of significance out of these short, ambiguous phrases. The words in the speech are impenetrable: generalized and impassive, very different from the concrete and particular language Shakespeare seems to use even for his most universal philosophy.&hellip; Various points, however, should lead us to a realization of the importance of the speech of Time. First of all we note its dense and complex grammar, with the syntactical ambiguities which often appear when Shakespeare is bent on conveying difficult and important ideas.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">148</hi>] The simplicity and impenetrability of the words are deliberate.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">149</hi>] It is enough to put Time on the stage, give him a speech of oracular obscurity, and let the play itself fill his words with particular meaning.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_llog82"><name type="app">Lloyd Evans</name></ref> (1982, p. 369): <quote>Despite the fact that [Time’s] words are neither stirring, philosophical, memorable or lyrical, his actual intervention at this point has a powerful influence on our experience of the play. There is no other play which at any given point offers such a tremendous sense that what has happened prior to the point is not only literally in the past but, as it were, historically and dramatically so.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lud74"><name type="app">Ludwig</name> (1974, p. 380)</ref>: The style of the speech <quote>is perfectly suited to its description of time as a force which brings together in itself all kinds of opposites.</quote> Time’s couplets contrast with patrician blank verse on the one hand and plebeian prose on the other.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tin37"><name type="app">Tinkler</name></ref> (1937, p. 350) takes note of an exception: <quote>Unlike the other rustics, who all speak in prose, the Shepherd speaks in verse which is yet very close to prose: it has a remarkably concrete quality, which at one level might be discussed in terms of a realism which is concerned with the depiction of a precise visual impression in the style of Dutch paintings.&hellip; The movement of the verse enacts the gestures of the speaking peasant, slow heavy gesture—<quote>pantler, butler, cook&hellip;welcomed all, served all</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1861" targetEnd="#tln_1862">1861–2</ref>]—which are never quite clumsy, and seem to bring remarkable weight behind each point as if the whole body were speaking.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cooh77"><name type="app">Cooper</name></ref> (1977, pp. 141, 143): <quote>When the Old Shepherd does speak in blank verse it is still in a naturalistic low style, not elevated beyond his rank [cites <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1865" targetEnd="#tln_1866">1865–6</ref>].&hellip; The integrity of pastoral life comes from its realism&hellip;and from the art that is rooted in nature.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">143</hi>] Moral value and linguistic simplicity are equated; the poetic theory reinforces the moral statement implicit in the world of pastoral.</quote></p>

<p>In discussing the language of shepherds, clowns, and servants, however, critics are usually talking about Sh.’s prose, despite <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stei63"><name type="app">Steiner</name></ref>’s (1961, p. 249) feeling that though the clown, the servants, and the shepherd <quote>speak in prose,&hellip;poetry knocks at every door.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_del1870"><name type="app">Delius</name></ref> (1870, pp. 228–9, 250–1) assigns Sh.’s prose to three different levels: The lowest befits Sh.’s clowns, though not only clowns speak it. Direct, unadorned, syntactically simple, it is natural for dialogue, less natural for monologue. At a higher level is the conversational prose of characters from upper social strata, marked by (p. 229) structured expressions and fairly complicated syntax and serving as a vehicle for intentional, subtle humor and wit. The highest level—euphuistic prose used in formal situations by the aristocrats and characterized by elegantly turned phrases and complicated metaphors and syntactic structures (antithesis especially)—is employed in the last plays to report on specific events or to establish a festive, ceremonial tone. Both (p. 250) 1.1 and 4.2 are euphuistic; 3.3 uses levels one and two (the Clown’s description of the shipwreck [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1530" targetEnd="#tln_1543">1530–43</ref>] demonstrates Sh.’s virtuosity); (p. 251) 5.2 combines levels one and three (in Ger.).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cram51"><name type="app">Crane</name></ref> (1951, p. 122) finds that the <quote>use of prose in exposition-scenes suggests Shakespeare’s desire to render his exposition more natural by introducing it into casual conversation,</quote> but <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chal70"><name type="app">Champion</name></ref> (1970, p. 165) finds the exposition of lines <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_44" targetEnd="#tln_47">44–7</ref> anything but natural: In describing <quote>the entertainment&hellip;and the long-lived and powerful bond of friendship between the two kings,</quote> Camillo and Archidamus use <quote>terms so extravagant as to suggest artificiality.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_felh72"><name type="app">Felperin</name></ref> (1972, p. 223) calls the idiom of these lines <quote>perfectly colloquial</quote> but adds: <quote>To the extent that their figures of speech play on the impossible and conjure up the miraculous, their language is&hellip;oracular, reflective of the romantic nature of the play as a whole.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_frea72"><name type="app">French</name></ref> (1972, pp. 135–6) believes that the two courtiers, <quote>more than half-aware of the absurdity</quote> of their speech, themselves burlesque it, thus raising <quote>implicit questions about what words the voice of true feeling could ever find in [Leontes’s] court.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tol89"><name type="app">Toliver</name></ref> (1989, p. 159): Camillo and Archidamus manage <quote>to suggest an opera buffa</quote> with their attempts at urbanity and their use of unwieldy language to describe supposedly <quote>powerful and enduring</quote> sentiments. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_har61"><name type="app">Harbage</name></ref> (1961, p. 444) insists, however, that Camillo’s speech, <quote>consistently straightforward and lucid,</quote> is the <quote><quote>normal</quote> language of the play.

<p>Dissecting the language of the other inhabitants of Bohemia, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bor55"><name type="app">Borinski</name></ref> (1955, pp. 64–5) finds the prose of the Shepherd and Clown <quote>basically&hellip;naturalistic&hellip;because these clowns are real peasants.&hellip; Their images are of the homeliest kind [cites <quote>as you’ld thrust a Corke into a hogshead</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1535" targetEnd="#tln_1536">1535–6</ref>)]. Yet their speech is nevertheless stylized. In such a passage as [<quote>the men are not yet cold vnder water, nor the Beare halfe din’d on the Gentleman: he’s at it now</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1546" targetEnd="#tln_1547">1546–7</ref>)] the effect is produced by means which might be deemed overdone in a purely realistic comedy; here it is stylization with poetic overtones.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_vic68"><name type="app">Vickers</name></ref> (1968, pp. 413, 420), <quote>pleased to discover more energy and invention in the lower medium [in <title level="m">WT</title>] than in any of the late comedies,</quote> notes that the Clown (p. 420), in promising to bury any scraps of Antigonus left behind after the bear finishes feeding, refers to Antigonus as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1570">1570</ref>), making <quote>left-overs</quote> of a human being and even further reducing Antigonus <quote>to a pronoun, and neuter at that.&hellip; By the clever manipulation of the sequence of [the Clown’s] speech and his use of imagery and rhetorical structure, Shakespeare has succeeded in completely dehumanizing the sailors and Antigonus (no deaths move us less), turning the potentially tragic into the comic.&hellip; This is surely the most creative adaptation of prose in all the last plays.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_harb89"><name type="app">Hardy</name></ref> (1989, pp. 21–2) also calls this <quote>great comic narrative.&hellip; The naive Clown is used to mimic maladroit telling.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">22</hi>] This is a rare instance of present tense, or nearly present-tense, narrative&hellip;up-to-date and immediate.&hellip; Its presentness has a special comic grisly vivacity.&hellip; The narration creates an emotional collision, comic and grotesque.</quote></p>

<p>The pastoral world also has its scoundrel. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bor55"><name type="app">Borinski</name></ref> (1955, p. 65): Autolycus is also <quote>differentiated from the peasants.&hellip; He is a clever rogue, and accordingly his speech is more intellectual, with a higher proportion of nouns and abstracts, even learned allusions and especially metaphors, always the surest sign of intellectuality. He is full of irony, but his irony is different from Falstaff’s; it is finer, gentler.&hellip; There is poetry in his roguery.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_trad55"><name type="app">Traversi</name></ref> (1955, pp. 181–4): Another segment of <quote>grave and involved prose [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3011" targetEnd="#tln_3182">3011–182</ref>] is seen, on closer reading, not to be mere decoration, but to belong to the spirit of the play, in forming which it plays its own distinctive part.&hellip; The Gentleman’s account of the finding of the child Perdita, as related by the Shepherd, and the manner of the telling, far from being an excursion into literary artifice, is admirably calculated both to maintain the necessary <quote>legendary</quote> quality of the episode&hellip;and to further the symbolic unity of the whole.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">183</hi>] The prose, at once carefully elaborated and finely evocative, is&hellip;a factor of primary importance.&hellip; The words of the Gentleman are charged with symbolic undertones [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3053" targetEnd="#tln_3056">3053–6</ref>].&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">184</hi>] The apparently contrary emotions of joy and sorrow have become fused.&hellip; The wrapping of this description in carefully elaborated forms of expression, coupled with the stressing of its similarity to an old <quote>tale</quote>, contributes to removing the action from common modes of feeling, and thus to the creation of the necessary symbolic atmosphere.</quote></p>

<p>Paradoxically, the conclusion (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3184">3184</ref> ff.) interests critics not for its dialogue but for its silences. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adar89"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1989, p. 105) finds it chilling that <quote>Leontes never addresses to his daughter a word that the audience can hear, nor does Polixenes say a word to his son; in fact, Leontes addresses only a brief sentence to Bohemia, perfunctorily begging pardon for his scandalous suspicions and his efforts to murder a sacred guest as well as a dear friend [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3361" targetEnd="#tln_3363">3361–3</ref>].</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mat69"><name type="app">Matchett</name></ref> (1969, p. 104): The statue scene, climaxing <quote>not in a burst of impassioned verse, but in a silent embrace,</quote> suggests not just a curious circumstance but a reflection of the play’s attention to the limitations of language. <quote>Silence, then, becomes the final language, the language of love and forgiveness which all can understand, the wordless communion in which the exchange is most complete.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dus75"><name type="app">Dusinberre</name></ref> (1975, p. 221): Words, especially those which <quote>give shape to Leontes’ imaginings, seem in the end suspect and inexpressive</quote>; Hermione and Leontes, reunited <quote>after sixteen years&hellip;embrace silently.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_barta80"><name type="app">Barton</name></ref> (1980, p. 148): Autolycus, genial mover of the plot, may first seem <quote>a hypocrite and dissembler</quote>; his <quote>real association, however, is with fictions rather than with genuine evil.

<p xml:id="para_0031"><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sle36"><name type="app">Sleeth</name></ref> (1936, pp. 97–8, 110–11) draws from sources of Sh.’s time (including Bacon and More) a description of the ideal Elizabethan counselor, applying to Camillo (but not to that other faithful servant, Paulina) the best qualities: noble blood, good name, prudence, wisdom, high standards of morality, concern for the common good, honesty, imperviousness to flattery, and so forth. Naturally, other critics debate whether Camillo measures up.</p>

<p>A few find him objectionably self-serving, especially in his flight to Bohemia. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_len1753"><name type="app">Lennox</name></ref> (1753, 2:82): Camillo, a <quote>treacher[ous] and self-interested</quote> creature, insinuates himself into the service of Polixenes to avoid the wrath of Leontes, then betrays Florizel’s confidences when he wishes to end his exile. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bir1848"><name type="app">Birch</name></ref> (1848, p. 521): Camillo is guilty of <quote>dissembling and falsehood,</quote> though his perfidies ultimately <quote>lead to a happy issue and the fulfilment of the oracle.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_foa71"><name type="app">Foakes</name></ref> (1971, p. 122): <quote>He first protests, but then goes along with Leontes and accepts the task of poisoning Polixenes, and finally runs away, simply abandoning the loved master who had brought him <quote>from meaner form&hellip;to worship</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_410" targetEnd="#tln_411">410–11</ref>).</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adar89"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1989, pp. 98–9): <quote>Though consistently labelled <quote>honest,</quote> and given to asserting things on his <quote>honor,</quote> [Camillo] is not, in the moment of crisis, much of a paragon. After feigning docile obedience to Leontes, he easily moves to conniving at the escape of Polixenes, while barely considering the fate to which he is abandoning Hermione; after promising to help Florizel against [Polixenes’s] bilious rage, he instantly goes back on his promise, and for the least loyal of reasons, his own desire to see Sicily again.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">99</hi>] Camillo, though a man of some rank and pretensions to honor, directly and unhesitatingly betrays his word given to Florizel.</quote></p>

<p>Generally, however, Camillo is admired. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hud1848"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (1848, 1:335): A <quote>venerable and amusing</quote> character, <quote>Camillo never deceives but when honesty requires it; and then he deceives to perfection.&hellip; He tries to do good or prevent evil by telling the truth, till he sees there is no hope, and then he effects his purpose by telling downright falsehoods&hellip;as if he were willing to be lost himself, provided he may thereby save others.&hellip; His integrity and wisdom [make] him a light to the councils and a guide to the footsteps of the greatest around him.&hellip; [Camillo is] the salt of society and the strength of government.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_llow1894"><name type="app">Lloyd</name></ref> (1894, pp. 165–6): Camillo’s <quote>virtue, which is his character, is the very growth of the trying circumstances by which he is surrounded. He is frank and bold to the fullest extent that is consistent with prudence and usefulness; he carries prudence and management to the fullest extent that consists with self-respect and honour. In truth he is as virtuous and direct as a man can be who is fain to live among the hard conditions of a court.&hellip; We must approve and admire the sagacity with which he proves the strength of unreasoning prejudice, and hoodwinks and eludes [<hi rend="italic">166</hi>] the power he can neither disabuse nor contend against.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tin37"><name type="app">Tinkler</name></ref> (1937, p. 356) notes <quote>the integrated balance of Camillo, the sane man of good sense.

<p>Camillo’s motivation and its results interest many critics.

<p>Others are resolute champions. <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_inc1808"><name type="app">Inchbald</name></ref> (ed. 1808, 3:6): The idea that <quote>Florizel should introduce himself to the court of Sicilia, by speaking arrant falsehoods</quote> is a <quote>disgraceful improbability</quote>; she makes sure that it is by adopting Kemble’s cuts of troublesome lines (see Text on the Stage, <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0018"/>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hud1848"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (1848, 1:333–4): <quote>Unless he were willing to give up all the rest of the world for her,</quote> Florizel is not worthy of Perdita.

<p>Not even Hermione earns uniform critical praise.

The doubts of Leontes, voiced openly concerning the lad’s paternity, have by no means an idealising effect upon her wifehood.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_matj13"><name type="app">Matthews</name></ref> (1913; 1970, p. 338): <quote>Her noble eloquence in the trial scene does not proceed from the mouth of the same woman whose witty banter has enlivened the opening episodes.

It is perhaps difficult for the reader to think of Hermione in negative terms, yet her cruel response to her husband’s merciless actions attests to a dark kinship between the spirits of Leontes and his wife.</quote></p>

<p>Most critics, however, countenance her behavior. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jama1889"><name type="app">Jameson</name></ref> (1833; 1889, pp. 188, 190): <quote>The character of Hermione is considered open to criticism on one point.&hellip; She secludes herself from the world for sixteen years&hellip;and is not won to relent from her resolve by [Leontes’s] sorrow, his remorse, his constancy to her memory: such conduct, argues the critic, is unfeeling as it is inconceivable in a tender and virtuous woman.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">190</hi>] Would his repentance suffice to restore him at once to his place in her heart, to efface from her strong and reflecting mind the recollection of his miserable weakness?&hellip;Methinks that the want of feeling&hellip;and [lack of] consistency would lie in such an exhibition as this.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hud1848"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (1848, 1:326–8): As <quote>afflictions thicken upon her, until she appears truly sublime,</quote> Hermione <quote>evinces a most deep, intense feeling of the awful indignity put upon her, and a lofty self-respect that scorns alike to resent it and to succumb to it.&hellip; Her conscious innocence can thus sustain her against the world.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">327</hi>] The firmness with which she persists for sixteen years in hiding her life from the king&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">328</hi>] is all in perfect keeping with her character.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1875"><name type="app">Dowden</name></ref> (1875; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dow1877">1877, pp. 412–13)</ref>: <quote>From the first Hermione, whose clear-sightedness is equal to her courage, had perceived that her husband laboured under a delusion which was cruel and calamitous to himself.

She will not shorten the term of his suffering, because that suffering is beneficent. And at the last her silent embrace carries with it—and justly—a portion of that truth she had uttered long before: [quotes <quote>how&hellip;mistake,</quote> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_701" targetEnd="#tln_705">701–5</ref>].

<p>A few critics find Hermione bland. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_des52"><name type="app">Desai</name></ref> (1952, p. 49): Compared with most of the women in Sh.’s comedies, Hermione is uninspiring, dull, and vapid. <quote>Not all the defence of her character by Mrs. Jameson [see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0021-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0021-b"/>] can reconcile us to her, after she leaves the court and goes into oblivion from which, not she, but her wraith, a statue almost like her, seems to have been brought and palmed off as Hermione.

<p>Some critics, however, find him less rounded than this. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sen50"><name type="app">Sen Gupta</name></ref> (1950, p. 241): Leontes is merely a theatrical tool who <quote>seems to be less a human being than a mechanical contrivance that sets the plot going.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> (ed. 1963, pp. lxxi ff.): Leontes is <quote>primarily an agent to bring an evil force rapidly into play</quote> rather than a character <quote>to be examined closely as a man; he is more important as a vehicle.&hellip; He is not shown as achieving humility, and his <quote>growth</quote> seems to be what may be described as an unavoidable minimum in the circumstances.</quote></p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0082"/>
<p>Many critics incline to this view, saying little about Leontes’s abiding personal and ethical nature but much about the single, aberrant trait that dominates the character’s development and behavior in the first segment of <title level="m">WT</title>—the violent jealousy.</p>

<p>A few readers see it as innate.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gau87"><name type="app">Gauger</name></ref> (1987, p. 28) alone suggests that Leontes’s overwhelming jealousy stems not from a character trait or flaw but from a philosophical attitude wherein normal and normally accepted opposites and contrasts seem suspended, and a course of action is allowed that can only be explained by extreme <quote>indifference</quote> to the dictates of a balanced course of action.

But, though we cannot help regretting her conduct, inasmuch as it tends to hinder where she means to help; neither can we help respecting and honouring her for it, inasmuch as it obviously springs from the noblest impulses.&hellip; Loud, voluble, violent, and viraginous, with a tongue that seems sharper than a sword, and an eloquence that seems enough to raise a blister, she has, however, too much honour and good sense to use them without good cause, and at the same time too much generous impulsiveness not to use them at all hazards when she has good cause.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jama1889"><name type="app">Jameson</name></ref> (1889; 1967, pp. 194–5, 197–8): Paulina is <quote>one of the striking beauties of the play[,]&hellip;strongly drawn from real and common life; a clever, generous, strong-minded, warm-hearted woman, fearless in asserting the truth, firm in her sense of right, enthusiastic in all her affections; quick in thought, resolute in word, and energetic in action</quote> but also (p. 195) <quote>heedless, hot-tempered, impatient, loud, bold, voluble, and turbulent of tongue; regardless of the feelings of those for whom she would sacrifice her life, and injuring from excess of zeal those whom she most wishes to serve.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">197</hi>] While we honour her courage and her affection, we cannot help regretting her violence.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">198</hi>] We can only excuse Paulina by recollecting that it is a part of her purpose to keep alive in the heart of Leontes the remembrance of his queen’s perfections, and of his own cruel injustice.</quote> Jameson’s observations influenced later critics; for example, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clac36"><name type="app">Clark</name></ref> (1936, pp. 76–7) repeats many of them, sometimes verbatim. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_clar1863"><name type="app">Clarke</name></ref> (1863, p. 356): <quote>Paulina is a specimen of those headstrong women who, taking up&hellip;a cause, allow no minor point to sway or interfere with their course of action.&hellip;There is another point in the female character that Shakespeare has exemplified with his usual felicity, in the conduct of Paulina.&hellip; When Leontes&hellip;is wallowing in the very slough of mean despondency, Paulina cannot forego the gratification of punching him in his maundering distress.</quote> The <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_cla1865"><name type="app">Clarke</name></ref>s (ed. 1865, 1:682, n. 49): <quote>In Paulina the poet has given us a perfect picture of one of those ardent friends whose warmth of temper and want of judgment injure the cause they strive to benefit.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sni1875"><name type="app">Snider</name></ref> (1875, p. 89): She is <quote>a courageous, strong-worded woman who is a little too free with her tongue over a penitent wrongdoer</quote>; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sni1877"><name type="app">Idem</name></ref> (1877, 2:63): <quote>Her husband is Antigonus, who was the boldest of the courtiers in defense of Hermione; yet he has submitted to his wife, who must, therefore, be still bolder than he.</quote></p>

<p>Critical admiration mixed with censure continues. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_brag1898"><name type="app">Brandes</name></ref> (1898, 2:351): <quote>She has more courage than ten men, and possesses that natural eloquence and power of pathos which determined honesty and sound common sense can bestow upon a woman.&hellip; She is untouched by sentimentality; there is as little of the erotic as there is of repugnance in her attitude towards her husband.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bet47"><name type="app">Bethell</name></ref> (1947, p. 60): Paulina has <quote>something of a <quote>morality</quote> flavour; she symbolises conscience, always at Leontes’ right shoulder to prompt him to right conduct. Yet she is a scold, presented as a comic figure, for the conscience in its nagging persistence can be both comic and serious at the same time.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_siml50"><name type="app">Simpson</name></ref> (1950, p. 122): <quote>The task of making her at once attractive and convincing is not rendered easier by the fact that she is a matron.&hellip; [Yet] all who have met the type can vouch for her genuineness. Impulsive alike in admiration of nobleness as in condemnation of meanness, she shows herself a&hellip;courageous and disinterested [champion] of Hermione.&hellip; From the moment she hears of the king’s conduct to his queen, she makes it her business to reveal to him the injustice of his charge.&hellip; Never does Paulina waver in her decision and determination to achieve this.&hellip; Nothing daunts her.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nut66"><name type="app">Nuttall</name></ref> (1966, p. 35): In Paulina’s <quote>ferocious castigation</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1362" targetEnd="#tln_1389">1362–89</ref>) of Leontes following his repentance (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1335" targetEnd="#tln_1357">1335–57</ref>), <quote>we must either find Paulina’s behaviour grotesquely unnecessary or else find something thin and only half-convincing in Leontes’ breast-beating. I think the second alternative is the right one. The king’s proposal to <quote>new-woo my queen, recall the good Camillo</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1341">1341</ref>], has too facile a confidence. Nevertheless there is something unpalatable in Paulina’s [response]. She is a goblin-figure, a little larger than life. Her ways and speech have something monstrous about them, alternately alarming and somehow enormously good.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gred67"><name type="app">Grene</name></ref> (1967, p. 79): Paulina acts bravely and with good intentions—but, of course, does harm. In confronting Leontes with his infant daughter, Paulina <quote>only forces Leontes over the brink to direct action and brings about the exposure of the child.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bel78"><name type="app">Bellette</name></ref> (1978, pp. 68–9): <quote>In many ways she is a counterpart of Camillo—a subject forced into <quote>disloyalty</quote> yet guardian of the truth and loyal to what the King himself has destroyed.

[<hi rend="italic">52</hi>] To be so often resuscitating distress&hellip;smacks rather of sadism.</quote></p>

<p>Some critics find no fault with Paulina at all. <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_inc1808"><name type="app">Inchbald</name></ref> (ed. 1808, 3:5): Paulina, <quote>all tenderness united with spirit, has such power over the scenes in which she is engaged for the protection of the new-born child, that, like the queen, she confers honour and interest upon Leontes, merely by his keeping such excellent company.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_llow1894"><name type="app">Lloyd</name></ref> (1894, p. 161): She is <quote>a necessity to the play; without the support derived from her constant presence, it would not be intelligible how such a mind as that of Leontes could have the force and freshness of feeling, after sixteen years elapsed, that are required&hellip;to satisfy our sympathies with the honour of Hermione.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_marh1891"><name type="app">Martin</name></ref> (1891, pp. 12, 19): <quote>She is a woman of no ordinary sagacity, with a warm heart, a vigorous brain, and an ardent temper. Her love for Hermione has its roots in admiration and reverence for all the good and gracious qualities of which the queen’s daily life has given witness. She has been much about her royal mistress, and much esteemed and trusted by her. Leontes, knowing this, obviously anticipates that she will not remain quiet when she hears of the charge he has brought against the queen, and he has thrust her into prison. Accordingly he has given express orders that Paulina is not to be admitted to the prison, and this fresh act of cruelty she learns from the governor only when she arrives there in hope of being of some comfort to her much-wronged mistress.</quote> Sh. uses Paulina to deliver (p. 19) <quote>the concentrated judgment of every man and woman in Leontes’ kingdom</quote> that Hermione is innocent.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_caz65"><name type="app">Cazamian</name></ref> (1931; 1965, pp. 293–4): Paulina is <quote>a worthy lady, a genuine creation, true in every feature to the slightly heightened life that drama demands. A courtier’s wife, she awes not only her husband, but the king’s officers and the royal person; she bears down all resistance—a triumph won by transparent honesty, courage, and the power of a biting tongue. The lively force of her railing is due to a robust hold [<hi rend="italic">294</hi>] upon the paradoxes of an absurd situation; indignation carries her forward, but shrewd sense guides her to victory. She is the instrument of the kindly fate that soothes, and finally heals, the souls poisoned or crushed by the madness of one selfish man.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_cam3"><name type="app">Wilson</name></ref> (ed. 1931, pp. xxiv, xxvi): She <quote>can hardly be praised too highly.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">xxvi</hi>] We remember [the play] by the full-charactered Paulina, fit companion for any woman, young or old.&hellip; She [stands] out by her tenacious courage and cunning.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_parn50"><name type="app">Parsons</name></ref> (1950, p. 228): Paulina stands out as <quote>essentially human, kind, true, loyal, courageous, impetuous, hot-tempered and outspoken.&hellip; She risks great danger for her love of a friend—without a shred of self-interest.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hol64"><name type="app">Holbrook</name></ref> (1964, pp. 162–4): Paulina is the <quote>embodiment of commonsense maturity and honesty in the court.&hellip; The several loyalties throughout the play are a subtle presentation of differing human sensibilites and their modes of behaviour in a situation where loyalty is called to act on its own responsibility, even at risk to life itself, so that the frail values of human relationship are given the ultimate test.</quote> Paulina represents (p. 163) <quote>a loyalty to the kingdom, and a desire to cure the community.</quote> Thus she never ceases to oppose Leontes but instead (p. 164) <quote>insists on the firm and normal reality of sound relationships and governing values, though she knows in this insistence that she faces death from the psychotic dictator. Yet she knows, too, that to insist on the norms is the only way to expose the aberration.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hur83"><name type="app">Hurd</name></ref> (1983, p. 303): Whether Paulina is functioning as the <quote>voice of moral justice,</quote> as the skillful stage manager who provides the perspective for our major insights about the play, or, in the last act, as the agent of reconciliation who, <quote>even more than the oracle, makes things work in this play,</quote> she is not only a pivotal character but <quote>the most admirable&hellip;in this, one of Shakespeare’s most beautiful plays.</quote> Others who unreservedly admire Paulina are: <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sme11"><name type="app">Smeaton</name></ref> (1911, p. 513), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_har61"><name type="app">Harbage</name></ref> (1961, p. 447), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hib64"><name type="app">Hibbard</name></ref> (1964, p. 113).</p>

<p>Some criticism focuses on gender. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shel02"><name type="app">Sherman</name></ref> (1902, p. 124): Sh. creates Paulina to temper Hermione’s <quote>self-sufficiency and strength</quote> and, by displaying <quote>mannish</quote> behavior herself, <quote>to remove all hint of mannishness</quote> from our perception of Hermione. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pyl69"><name type="app">Pyle</name></ref> (1969, pp. 41, 43): In Sh.’s time <quote>there were exceptional women, from Queen Elizabeth down, and for them allowance had to be made</quote> by the rest of society. Paulina, <quote>of conspicuous goodness,</quote> is actually capable of exercising <quote>a man’s determination of character&hellip;in the service of the right.</quote> She is (p. 43) <quote>unmannerly only when the king is mad, and to the king’s true self&hellip;a <quote>loyal servant</quote> and <quote>obedient counsellor</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_965" targetEnd="#tln_966">965–6</ref>], speaking out for his own good.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dus75"><name type="app">Dusinberre</name></ref> (1975, pp. 220–1): Paulina’s conscience, like Hermione’s innocence, compels speech, but Paulina <quote>bows to femininity with an orator’s subtlety, talking incessantly of subjects on which she protests womanly silence [e.g., at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1409" targetEnd="#tln_1423">1409–23</ref>]</quote>; her eloquence (p. 221) <quote>contrasts with the cowardly silence of Leontes’ courtiers.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_asp78"><name type="app">Asp</name></ref> (1978, pp. 147–56) finds in Paulina a likeness of <quote>the Renaissance counterpart of the female <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">consolatio</foreign> figure found in many medieval works.&hellip; There are striking parallels</quote> between the two <quote>that would explain Paulina’s dominance within the action of the play and her unique function vis-à-vis Leontes.</quote> For example, the female advisor (p. 150) is <quote>always dominant in the relationship</quote> and seems to possess <quote>part of the divine <foreign xml:lang="grk-latn" rend="italic">numen</foreign>, a fact that gives her words authority and a certain infallibility within the limits of her nature. She is usually a solitary figure so that her preeminence is not compromised by&hellip;conflicting authorities.&hellip; She rebukes and shames her subject.&hellip; Then she uses reasoned arguments to prove her points.&hellip; Finally, she encourages him to persevere in his new wisdom.</quote> Having been willingly accepted as Leontes’s advisor [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1424" targetEnd="#tln_1426">1424–6</ref>], Paulina leads him (p. 154) through the steps of purgation—guilt, contrition, repentance, confession, and amendment—to a (p. 156) <quote>reunion with the goodness and grace emanating from Hermione.</quote> All the ensuing reunions are <quote>symbolic expressions of that union with divine love which is the final end of medieval consolation literature.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_enge82"><name type="app">England</name></ref> (1982, p. 75) also suggests that Paulina’s <quote>name is not only intentionally Christian but may even suggest her role as a healer in the Pauline tradition.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berp80"><name type="app">Berggren</name></ref> (1980, pp. 29–30): Paulina <quote>seals the image of feminine power in the late plays</quote> by preserving the maternal heroine and perhaps by being <quote>introduced to us as the mother of three girls, sufficient recommendation in a world where boy children die of shock while infant girls survive far [<hi rend="italic">30</hi>] worse.&hellip; Paulina seems the most selfless of all Shakespeare’s women, ruthless in a cause that offers no personal profit whatsoever.</quote> When Leontes calls her a <quote>mankind witch</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_982">982</ref>), the adjective <quote>perfectly encapsulates the spirit of [<title level="m">WT</title>], which exorcises the violence of masculine jealousy and redeems it through the kind of patience Penelope achieved.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_das80"><name type="app">Dash</name></ref> (1980, pp. 275–6): Paulina <quote>exhibits a fearlessness and self-confidence that suggest her later role as the scourge of Leontes.&hellip; [In the jail scene] her brilliance, wit, and sophistication sparkle. Thus introduced, neither as a lady-in-waiting to the Queen nor as a member of Hermione’s staff, Paulina functions as an independent, a woman with a staff of her own.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">276</hi>] Although the range of her capacities is still a mystery to us—and will remain so until the play’s closing scene—we know that her challenge to the men to <quote>be second</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_930">930</ref>] to them in courage and imaginative action is not empty ranting.</quote> The line actually reads <quote>be second to me.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cala82"><name type="app">Calder-Marshall</name></ref> (1982, p. 246): Paulina <quote>probably talks too much, but she is the only person who confronts Leontes with what he’s done and what kind of person he’s becoming.&hellip; Paulina has no tact. She’s very much a woman of today, dare one say a feminist in the best sense of the word? She’s the sort of friend that everyone would like to have when things are going badly. She’s loyal and fights like a tiger.

Throughout the play she takes on Leontes as an equal, undaunted by his tyranny. When she speaks of herself as <quote>a foolish woman</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1418">1418</ref>], it is plainly only a rhetorical gesture.</quote> She (p. 177) restores <quote>Hermione to Leontes’ esteem and finally to his presence</quote> and then accepts Leontes’s marital arrangements, seemingly designed to <quote>place her back in a patriarchal framework</quote>: but of course <quote>she has already demonstrated unambiguously how little marriage subordinates her.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nee85"><name type="app">Neely</name></ref> (1985, pp. 199–200): Though she <quote>absorbs the most brutal of the verbal and physical expressions of Leontes’ repudiation of Hermione and his daughter&hellip;[Paulina] believes [<hi rend="italic">200</hi>] Leontes is salvageable—and worth saving for [Hermione].&hellip; Her attacks on Leontes&hellip;are calculated, judicious, positive.</quote></p>

<p>Though <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_carn56"><name type="app">Carrington</name></ref> (1956, p. 25) calls Paulina <quote>an inconsistent and undeveloped character,</quote> most critics think otherwise; they apparently feel, however, that she cannot be discussed or judged in a vacuum, so they often look at the roles, traditional and otherwise, that she plays in <title level="m">WT</title>. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_matj13"><name type="app">Matthews</name></ref> (1913; 1970, p. 338): Paulina <quote>plays her part, urged by her own individuality</quote>; she never becomes a <quote>mere creature of the story, a puppet pulled to and fro by the playwright to compel the forward movement of the plot.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_her1916"><name type="app">Herford</name></ref> (ed. 1916–, p. xxiii): Paulina plays the part of <quote>an earthly providence, intervening in the action at its most critical point to forestall disaster and turn the menacing perils to a happy issue.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_davw39"><name type="app">Davies</name></ref> (1939, p. 147): <quote>Paulina is carefully and vigorously drawn, and has the sympathy of the audience from her first appearance.&hellip; She gets the better of Leontes in a very brisk quarrel [963– 1058] and has a fine exit in the same scene.

<p>Other critics use the term <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> in reference to Perdita’s intrinsic superiority. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_armj69"><name type="app">Armstrong</name></ref> (1969, p. 67): <quote>Full grown, Perdita, Queen of the feast, her royal origin proclaiming itself even in rural exile, is an intensely attractive figure, partly because of spontaneity and warm generous sensuality.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berk85"><name type="app">Berkeley</name> &amp; <name type="app">Karimipour</name></ref> (1985, pp. 90–3): Perdita, a princess of the best blood raised in low condition, illustrates that <quote>good blood is obviously the essence, the transmitter of human excellence.</quote> Perdita’s royal blood ensures the retention of (p. 91) <quote>all her wonderful characteristics even in deprivation</quote>; it is further indicated by her beauty, (p. 92) <quote>angelic intelligence,</quote> sweet and refined speech, <quote>highly developed sense of tact,</quote> (p. 93) lack of condescension to her supposed family, and <quote>disdain</quote> of indecencies. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_adar89"><name type="app">Adams</name></ref> (1989, pp. 107–8): <quote>The daughter of royalty, Perdita is instinctively, <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi>, recognized as superior to her humble adopted environment.

<p>For a few critics, no such distinctions are possible. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hud1848"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (1848, 1:331–2): Perdita has <quote>native intelligence as distinguished from artificial acquirements, and inborn dignity bursting through all the disadvantages of the humblest station.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">332</hi>] The graces of the princely and the simplicities of the pastoral character seem striving which shall express her loveliest.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_schl22"><name type="app">Schücking</name></ref> (1922; 1948, p. 246): Perdita is <quote>a child of nature, a king’s daughter who has grown up among simple shepherd folk. But she keeps within the limits of realism, and is, moreover, endowed with the whole wealth of personal touches which go to make up a Shakespearean character. She is modest, unassuming, not submissive, however, but independent, full of natural dignity, frank, gay, adroit, sparkling with youthful vivacity, intelligent, with all sorts of carefully cultivated little interests, possessed of that instinctive knowledge of the world which is so truly feminine, profound, sincere, full of genuine feeling and tender reverence, confident and brave. What an intense and exuberant vitality!</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cohw82"><name type="app">Cohen</name></ref> (in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cohw82"><name type="app">Greenblatt</name></ref>, ed. 1982, p. 130): <quote>Perdita serves&hellip;[to unite] court with country and upper class with lower</quote> because she is <quote>the product of her innate nobility</quote> but also of sixteen years of life with the Shepherd and the Clown.</p>

<p>Many critics think Perdita’s virtues reflect Hermione’s part in her. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hud1848"><name type="app">Hudson</name></ref> (1848, 1:332–3): With <quote>the same delicacy and chastity of honour as her mother, she has less sternness and severity of carriage.&hellip; [<hi rend="italic">333</hi>] With her mother’s depth, intensity and calmness of feeling, no perturbations can reach her.</quote> Nor does he later (ed. 1852, 4:18–19) see reason to change his mind. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_halh1871"><name type="app">Hall</name></ref> (1871, p. 245): <quote>Perdita possesses fully the nature of her mother.

This is the mother’s intellect in the child.&hellip; In this handing down of similarity of character, Shakespere is perhaps scientifically and certainly poetically right; and he supports this idea of his throughout the rest of the play. Perdita, with a difference, descends from her mother.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tile62b"><name type="app">Tillyard</name></ref> (1938; 1962, pp. 46–7): <quote>Other parts of her character are a deep-seated [<hi rend="italic">47</hi>] strength and ruthless common sense.&hellip; It is through Perdita’s magnificence that we accept as valuable the new life into which the play is made to issue.&hellip; She is Hermione’s true daughter and prolongs in herself those regenerative processes which in her mother have suffered a temporary eclipse.</quote> Only <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_webm42"><name type="app">Webster</name></ref> (1942; 1955, p. 278) disagrees: The fact that Perdita is the image of her mother is <quote>the least important thing about her.

<p>Some critics, tempted to dwell on possible flaws in Perdita, easily find reason not to, leaving the perfect princess intact. <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_inc1808"><name type="app">Inchbald</name></ref> (ed. 1808, 3:6): <quote>Quite as improbable as the unprovoked jealousy</quote> of Leontes is that <quote>the gentle, the amiable, the tender Perdita, should be an unconcerned spectator of the doom which menaced her father; and carelessly forsake him in the midst of his calamities.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_llow1894"><name type="app">Lloyd</name></ref> (1894, p. 167): The eagerness of the Shepherd and the Clown to avoid Polixenes’s wrath by disclaiming responsibility for Perdita <quote>acquits her of ingratitude as well as presumption in moving easily towards the superior rank due to her nature as to her descent. Her own courage and collectedness at once place her in contrast to the bewildered and frightened hinds, and bring her worthily into sympathy with the patience and self-support of her brave mother Hermione.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_matj13"><name type="app">Matthews</name></ref> (1913; 1970, pp. 339–40): <quote>Perdita is more than the story requires. She is one of Shakespeare’s most enchanting heroines. She may be lauded by other characters in the play and her beauty may be praised by all who gaze upon it. But she is not dependent for her charm upon any eulogy from others. She speaks for herself; she is what she is&hellip;an ideal of ineffable maidenhood.</quote> Though she (p. 340) falls from grace once, in deserting her supposed father when he is threatened with death, <quote>this is only what one must expect in a dramatic-romance.</quote></p>

<p xml:id="para_0007">Six performances of <title level="m">WT</title> in the 17th c. can be identified with certainty. On 15 May 1611 Simon Forman visited the Globe Th. to see <title level="m">WT</title> acted by the King’s Men (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae23"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>, 1923, 2:216). Court records attest to a further five performances by the King’s Men at the First and Second Banqueting Houses, Whitehall: 5 Nov. 1611, in the presence of King James (4:177); 1612–13, in a season of 14 plays in honor of the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and the Elector Palatine and in the presence of Prince Charles, the Princess, and the Elector (4:180); Easter Tuesday, 7 Apr. 1618, in the presence of King James (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>, 1930, 2:346); 18 Jan. 1623/4, in the presence of the Duchess of Richmond (2:347); and 16 Jan. 1633/4 (2:352). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref> suggests that the inclusion of <title level="m">WT</title> in a 1619 MS list of plays drawn up in the Revels Office (see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0022-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0022-b"/>) may indicate that it was among the plays being <quote>considered for performance at Court,</quote> c. 1619–20 (2:346); <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ben41"><name type="app">Bentley</name></ref> (1941, 1:95, n.

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt27"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref> (1927, ch. 9, chart 4) assigns the parts for the play’s initial performance: Leontes = Richard Burbadge (or Burbage), Autolycus = John Lowin, Shepherd = Henry Cundall (or Condell), Polixenes = William Ostler, Camillo = John Heminges, Florizel = John Underwood, Clown = Robert Armin, Antigonus = Alexander Cooke, Paulina = John Rice, Hermione = James Sands, Perdita = Richard Robinson, Mamillius = Armin’s apprentice. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref> (1982, pp. 13, 244, n. 11) accepts <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_balt27"><name type="app">Baldwin</name></ref>’s assignment of Leontes, but assigns Autolycus to Armin, Hermione <quote>possibly</quote> to John Rice, and Paulina to Robinson.</p>

<p>The only contemporary comments on 17th-c. performances are the entry in Forman’s diary and the entry in the court record for 1633–4, which notes that the performance was <quote>likt</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chae30"><name type="app">Chambers</name></ref>, 1930, 2:352). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref> (1982, pp. 12–27 <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">passim</foreign>) conjectures details of early staging and performance (1611–34).

<p><title level="m">WT</title> and its adaptations, chiefly those by Macnamara Morgan and David Garrick, were performed in London 112 times in the 18th c. In the period 1701–50, <title level="m">WT</title> played 14 times in two seasons. Between 1751 and 1800, adaptations dominated; they account for all but two of the 98 performances in 29 seasons. The revivals and adaptations were popular choices for benefits (45 performances), and they were played at the command of their majesties twice and of the Prince of Wales thrice (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_vanw60"><name type="app">Van Lennep</name> et al., 1960–8, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">passim</foreign></ref>; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_schb79"><name type="app">Schneider</name></ref>, 1979). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat76"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref> (1987, 2:120) lists one anonymous, late-18th-c. promptbook, made on Tonson’s 1758 ed. of Garrick’s alteration.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to determine whose adaptation was performed. For example, the performance at Covent Garden 12 Mar. 1774 has been described both <quote><hi rend="italic">as altered</hi> by Garrick</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hog52"><name type="app">Hogan</name></ref>, 1957, 2:682) and as <quote>seem[ing] to be some adaptation of Garrick’s <title level="m">Florizel and Perdita</title></quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stog60"><name type="app">Stone</name></ref>, 1962, 4:1792). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_das71"><name type="app">Dash</name></ref> (1971) and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ped81"><name type="app">Pedicord</name></ref> (1981) speculate about the adapter of versions performed from the late 1750s to the early 1770s, including an abbreviated Garrick version that eliminates Hermione. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_das71"><name type="app">Dash</name></ref> (p. 154, n. 13) lists performances of versions attributed to more than one adapter.</p>

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0025-a"/>
<p>Before Garrick’s version captured the stage, an unadapted <title level="m">WT</title>, announced as <quote>Not Acted these Hundred Years,</quote> was revived at Goodman’s Fields on 15 Jan. 1741 between two parts of a concert; it played 8 times in January and once in April. Manager Henry Giffard, as Leontes, led the cast (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lon60"><name type="app">Scouten</name></ref>, 1961, 3:847, 881). The next season Covent Garden revived <title level="m">WT</title> for a further five performances, the first at the command of the Prince and Princess of Wales (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lon60"><name type="app">Scouten</name></ref>, 1961, 3:942). The final performance, on 21 Jan. 1742, presages the next chapter in <title level="m">WT</title>’s stage history: <quote>A New Grand Ballet call’d the <title level="m">Rural Assembly</title></quote> was presented <quote>with all new habits and other decorations proper to the entertainment</quote> and with an expanded cast: Chasseur, Pastors, Shepherdesses, Nymph of the Plain, Old Herdsman, Cottage Nymph, Two Nymphs of the Vale, and a Sylvan (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lon60"><name type="app">Scouten</name></ref>, 1961, 3:961). This elaboration of the sheepshearing scene anticipated the adaptations that would dominate the second half of the century.</p>

<p>The first of these was Morgan’s popular <title level="m">Florizel and Perdita; or, The Sheep Shearing</title>, an afterpiece in two acts with music by Thomas Arne, which played at Covent Garden and Drury Lane for approximately 25 performances in 12 seasons over a span of 44 years, from its premiere, 25 Mar. 1754, to its last performance, 12 May 1798. Morgan’s adaptation cuts the Sicilian scenes. He introduces Pan to sing <quote>Shepherds hear the voice of Pan</quote> at the rural feast and a priest to solemnize the marriage of Florizel and Perdita. Writing about the performance at Covent Garden on 24 March 1761, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gen1832"><name type="app">Genest</name></ref> (1832, 4:626) observes that <quote>this piece seems to have been turned into an Opera to suit the prevailing taste of this theatre.</quote> More bluntly, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_arc1887"><name type="app">Archer</name></ref> (1887, p. 512) describes it as <quote>nothing but the fourth act [of <title level="m">WT</title>], torn from its context and <quote>written up</quote> by a forgotten playwright.</quote></p>

<p>More popular than Morgan’s adaptation, Garrick’s version in three acts, originally announced as <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> but also known as <title level="m">Florizel and Perdita</title>, played over 60 times in 18 seasons between 1756 and 1795. During its first season it was performed 13 times; during the season of 1779–80, it was the second most popular show in the repertoire, playing 15 times, just three fewer than Sheridan’s hit <title level="m">The School for Scandal</title>. Garrick based his adaptation on Acts 3, 4, and 5; conflated several gentlemen to create Rogero, taking the name from <title level="m">WT</title> <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3031">3031</ref>; truncated the statue scene; and added speeches (see <ptr targType="item" target="#item_009_1"/>). Michael Arne wrote <quote>The Sheep-Shearing Song</quote> for Susanna Cibber, who created Garrick’s Perdita. In many productions thereafter, Perdita, another character, or a vocalist performed <quote>Come, come, my good shepherds, our flocks we must shear.</quote> William Charles Macready cut the song in 1837 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 8).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0021">Garrick’s <quote>masterly</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_davt1808"><name type="app">Davies</name></ref>, 1808, 1:314) Leontes introduced the business of stepping back when Hermione comes down from the pedestal.

The reference to <quote>the temple</quote> and the engraving based on Robert Edge Pine’s portrait of Pritchard in which she wears a cross in 5.3 (see below) associate Hermione for the first time with Christian iconography. Cibber’s delightful <quote>grace</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mur1801"><name type="app">Murphy</name></ref>, 1801, 1:286) and <quote>neat simplicity in singing</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gen1832"><name type="app">Genest</name></ref>, 1832, 4:446) created a Perdita unrivaled until 1845. Margaret Martyr, who had played Mopsa (May 1785), was the first actress to play Florizel as a breeches part.</p>

<p>Less successful were <title level="m">The Sheep-Shearing; or, Florizel and Perdita</title>, an adaptation by George Colman the Elder, which was performed in summer seasons at the Haymarket, once in 1777 and twice in 1783, and a revival of Sh.’s unaltered <title level="m">WT</title>, <quote>not acted for 30 years,</quote> which played twice at Covent Garden, 24 Apr. 1771 and 4 May 1772, for the benefit of Thomas Hull, who prepared the text and first doubled Camillo and Time (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stog60"><name type="app">Stone</name></ref>, 1962, 4:1543).

<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0025-b"/>

<p>Eighteenth-century illustrations reveal details of possible costuming and stage design; portraits and engravings of actresses as Hermione may shed light on the performers’ interpretations of the role. John Zoffany painted Elizabeth Farren as Hermione (c. 1780; see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_higp73"><name type="app">Highfill</name></ref> et al., 1978, 5:163). Engravings portray Pritchard as Hermione in 5.3 (1765; see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_higp73"><name type="app">Highfill</name></ref> et al., 1987, 12:178), Elizabeth Hartley as Hermione in 5.3 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#s_gent"><name type="app">Gentleman</name></ref>, 2nd ed., 1775), Isabella Mattocks as Hermione in <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_717" targetEnd="#tln_719">717–19</ref> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_genf1774"><name type="app">Hull</name></ref>, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_genf1774"><name type="app">Gentleman</name></ref>, ed. 1774), Richard Yates as Autolycus in 4.3 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_gar1785"><name type="app">Garrick</name></ref>, ed. 1785), and the discovery of Perdita in 3.3 (Gent, ed. 1773). See also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_mer59"><name type="app">Merchant</name></ref> (1959, pp. 208–20).</p>

<p>In the first half of the 19th c., actor-managers gradually restored much of Sh.’s text (see <ptr targType="item" target="#item_009_7 #item_009_8 #item_009_9"/>), attempted historical accuracy in costume and scenic design, and filled out the stage picture in scenes such as 1.1 and 3.2 with numerous silent characters. Kemble, who had included Garrick’s adaptation in his first season as manager of Drury Lane (1788) and then dropped the adaptation from the repertoire, produced <title level="m">WT</title> at Drury Lane on 25 Mar. 1802 (11 performances) and revived the production at Covent Garden in 1807 (6 performances) and 1811 (<quote>several</quote> performances [<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat74"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1974, 9.3:1; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_gen1832"><name type="app">Genest</name>, 1832, 8:286–97 <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">passim</foreign></ref> lists five performances in 1811–12]). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat74"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref> (1974, 9.3:iii) catalogs five promptbooks for the production, in which Kemble played Leontes and Sarah Siddons Hermione.</p>

<p>Kemble’s only uncomplimentary critic, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_anon1802"><name type="app">Anon</name></ref>. (1802), complains about the visual confusion caused by the designers, who mixed historical periods in the properties and costumes for the newly restored Sicilian scenes. Kemble’s staging of 3.2, which introduced properties emblematic of regal power and more than 40 extras, became the dominant model imitated or modified by 19th-c. actor-managers. By making Leontes and his court the focus of a formal stage picture and by placing Hermione and her three female attendants at the greatest possible distance from Leontes, Kemble intensified the emotional distance between the king and his falsely accused queen. To reinforce visually the shift from the public trial to Leontes’s private remorse, Kemble broke 3.2 after Hermione is borne off by the women (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1334">1334</ref> approximately) and played the rest of 3.2 as a new scene in Leontes’s closet.</p>

<p>Kemble’s production influenced Charles Young (Covent Garden, 1819), William Charles Macready (Drury Lane, 1823), John Vandenhoff (Drury Lane, 1834), Samuel Phelps and Amelia Warner (Sadler’s Wells, 1845), and Warner (Marylebone Th., 1847). Warner had played Hermione for Macready at Drury Lane and for Phelps at Sadler’s Wells, and her <title level="m">WT</title> was one of the <quote>most successful productions</quote> of her management of the Marylebone (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ode27"><name type="app">Odell</name></ref>, 1931, 6:123). The Theatre Royal Bristol also based its productions of 1819 and 1824 on Kemble’s version.</p>

<p>Between 3 Nov. 1823 and 30 May 1843, Macready, who had first played Leontes in Bath in 1815 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_polf1875"><name type="app">Pollock</name></ref>, 1875, 1:113), revived <title level="m">WT</title> for seven seasons at Drury Lane and three at Covent Garden. In 1837 Macready altered Kemble’s staging of 3.2 to make the stage picture less formal and more appropriate to Macready’s interpretation of Leontes (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0020"/>). In 1837 he also excised Garrick’s additions to the text and introduced Helen Faucit, who would become the most acclaimed Hermione since Siddons.</p>

<p>Phelps and Warner’s revival, which opened 29 Nov. 1845 for a season of 45 performances, played a total of 137 times in nine seasons at Sadler’s Wells, where it closed on 29 Sept. 1862 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alls71"><name type="app">Allen</name>, 1971, pp. 314–15</ref>). Indebted to Kemble’s production as modified by Macready in 1837, Phelps was <quote>evidently</quote> the first to give <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>a wholly Grecian setting</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 65). More significantly, Phelps was the first producer to demonstrate the advantages of staging <title level="m">WT</title> in a theater smaller than Covent Garden and Drury Lane. In the more intimate Sadler’s Wells Th., actors conveyed more effectively the thoughts and emotions in Sh.’s poetry (pp. 78–9).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0038">Kean’s <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">tableaux vivants</foreign> included a sumptuous farewell banquet in honor of Polixenes (1.2), at which 36 youths performed a Pyrrhic dance. Kean set 3.2 in the theater at Syracuse and filled the stage with more than 170 extras, including 45 children. Time, last seen in London productions in 1771 carrying his scythe and glass, was transformed into Cronus; Cronus, Luna, the stars, and Phoebus presented an elaborate, three-part allegory of the passage of time. The statue scene opened with a <quote>procession by torchlight</quote> (<title level="j">Standard</title>, 1 May 1856) including six principals and more than 100 extras.

<p>Kean’s influence spread to the provinces, where it was greater than in London, and to the US. <quote>Faint echoes</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 185) of the banquet in 1.2 can be discerned as late as 1958 (see below, <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0022"/>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel62"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1962, p. 78) discusses <quote>two theatrical burlesques [of 1856] both aimed, to some extent, at this production.</quote> William Burton’s were the first significant productions in the US. His first (Burton’s Th., New York, 1851), about which little is known, featured Warner as Hermione. His next (Burton’s Th., 1856) achieved a measure of independence from London. Anticipating by two months Kean’s restoration of Time, Burton staged him as the traditional figure, carrying a scythe and hour glass. Burton was the first to stage Act 1 before a backdrop of Mt. Etna, which erupted along with Leontes’s jealousy. At least one other production (that of the Saxe-Meiningen Co., which performed <title level="m">WT</title> in London in 1881) provided a view of Etna to locate the play in Sicilia (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 115). In 1857, reviving <title level="m">WT</title> at the larger New Th., Broadway, Burton retained some elements from 1856 (Mt. Etna and an English setting for the Bohemian scenes, for example), incorporated elements from Kean’s production (such as the Pyrrhic dance and the theater at Syracuse), and expanded Kean’s allegory of the passage of time by adding such spectacle as a display of the zodiacal signs and the personification of the Four Seasons (Playbill).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0052">Charles and Adelaide Calvert (Prince’s Th., Manchester, 1869) borrowed from and adapted Kean’s version and introduced spectacle and effects that their successors would in turn borrow from them.

<p>In 1878, 22 years after Kean’s production, <title level="m">WT</title> returned to London with effects borrowed from Kean, Calvert, and Saker. F. B. Chatterton’s <quote>magnificent and instructive spectacle</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 30 Sept. 1878) at Drury Lane, however, was neither a critical nor a financial success.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0039">The last major production of <title level="m">WT</title> of the 19th c., by the American actress Mary Anderson, opened in Nottingham, was transferred to the Lyceum (1887), and toured the US (1888). Although it was unpopular with the critics, it was the longest-running production of the 19th c., including 164 nights in London (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name>, 1982, pp. 116–17</ref>). It influenced the first <title level="m">WT</title> at Stratford-upon-Avon (1895; see below) and Viola Allen’s production in New York (1904). Forbes-Robertson was Leontes. Anderson’s heavily cut text reduced the running time to 2 hours, 8 minutes, and five acts to thirteen scenes. The chief novelty of the production was her decision to play both Hermione and Perdita, roles she was the first to double. Anderson retained the Calverts’ storm and Saker’s lighting effect; she modified the religious tone the Calverts had introduced into 5.3.</p>

<p>For the first production at Stratford-upon-Avon, Ben Greet borrowed the music composed for Anderson’s and staged the shepherds’ dance, <quote>as nearly as possible a reproduction</quote> of Anderson’s (<title level="j">Birmingham Daily Post</title>, 24 Apr. 1895). As had Anderson, Greet excised Kean’s spectacle, such as the allegory of the passage of time, and borrowed the storm introduced by Calvert and enhanced by Saker.</p>

<p>Kemble’s restoration of the Sicilian scenes opened the way for reinterpretation of Leontes and Hermione. Kemble and Siddons established standards by which their successors would be judged, and introduced business their successors would continue or sometimes modify. The 19th-c. actor was expected to retain Leontes’s regal bearing (<quote>the dignity of the King</quote>) while revealing his jealousy (<quote>the emotions of the man</quote>) (<title level="j">Daily Advertiser</title>, 12 May 1807). On the occasion of Kemble’s retirement, Hazlitt (<title level="j">Times</title>, 25 June 1817, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_howp30"><name type="app">Howe</name></ref>, 1930, 5:377) recalled his fine playing of <quote>the growing jealousy of the King, and the exclusive possession which this passion gradually obtains over his mind.</quote> Kemble’s delivery of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_377" targetEnd="#tln_389">377–89</ref> marked the development of Leontes’s conviction of and despair at Hermione’s adultery. Leontes’s entrance in 2.1 with 17 men shattered the domestic atmosphere; a courtier named Thasius, not one of the anonymous officers or guards, obeyed Leontes’s order to remove Mamillius (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 3); and a chilling annotation directs Leontes to throw <quote>Mamillius over to Thasius</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 4).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0020">Although some reviewers in 1823 complained about Macready’s giving Leontes an inappropriate stammer, about his rewriting of lines, and about his incomprehensibly rapid delivery, the assessment was predominantly complimentary. In Macready’s performance, which gave the king <quote>less of dignity</quote> than Kemble had done, <quote>the incipient jealousy&hellip;gradually ripening into a conviction of his consort’s guilt, and finally terminating in bitter hatred, was traced through all its tortuous ramifications</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 4 Nov. 1823). Macready’s numerous changes in stage position in 1.2, recorded in James R. Anderson’s partbook for Florizel and for Leontes (for whom he was understudy), testify to Macready’s restless energy (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 8). His <quote>energy and fire</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 4 Nov. 1823) illuminated, especially, the statue scene, which reviewers applauded unanimously. <quote>His burst of emotion on recovering his long-lost <hi rend="italic">Hermione</hi>&hellip;was very finely conceived and executed,</quote> observed <title level="j">The Examiner</title> (1823). Modifying Garrick’s business, Macready retreated from the statue when Paulina said she could awaken it. When the statue seemed to move, <quote>he appeared for a time annihilated; lost in amazement, and love, and joy. But when she descended from the pedestal and moved forward a few paces, the persuasion that she is a thing of life becomes irresistible, and&hellip;he rushes convulsively into her embraces</quote> (<hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>, 2 Oct. 1837). Looking back on the statue scene, Helen Faucit, by then Lady Martin, recalled Macready’s <quote>passionate joy [that] seemed beyond control</quote> (<title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Mag.</title>, 1891).</p>

<p>In contrast with Macready, who made <quote>rapid transitions,</quote> Phelps made a <quote>gradual transition from one state of mind to another, with an underlying struggle of emotions</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alls71"><name type="app">Allen</name></ref>, 1971, p. 178). Phelps’s major contribution was to embody Coleridge’s interpretation of Leontes as a man with <quote>a genuine jealousy of disposition&hellip;having certain well known and well defined effects and concomitants</quote> (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_218">181–92</ref>). Phelps’s creation <quote>was not&hellip;a sympathetic character, and yet it was so convincing on the stage that spectators were held in the grip of the emotions displayed. They felt the climax of the statue scene with a palpable shock</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alls71"><name type="app">Allen</name>, 1971, pp. 177–8</ref>). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref> (1982, p. 78): <quote>By 1858&hellip;Phelps had begun to play Leontes as <quote>an ancient Greek king,</quote></quote> accommodating his interpretation to the Grecian design.</p>

<p>Kean, the first actor to establish Leontes’s jealousy from the very beginning of 1.2, relied on elaborate visual effects to convey it (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 87). To mark the transition from <quote>the irascible tyrant</quote> to <quote>the dejected sufferer,</quote> Kean fainted when Paulina announced Hermione’s death (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 21).</p>

<p>As had Kean, Henry B. Irving, in the first production of <title level="m">WT</title> at Stratford-upon-Avon, portrayed Leontes’s jealousy from the moment he stepped on the stage, <quote>a gloomy, restless, and irritable man</quote> who lacked <quote>some degree of dignity</quote> (<title level="j">Daily Chronicle</title>, 25 Apr. 1895). At the trial, <quote>when he sat upon the throne of Justice, stern, immovable, pitiless, and powerful, he looked the picture of an imperious tyrant whose sole being was actuated by a revengeful spirit</quote> (<title level="j">The Sunday Chronicle</title>, 28 Apr. 1895).</p>

<p>A major challenge to the 19th-c. actress was to portray the lighter side of Hermione. The outstanding tragic actress of her generation, Siddons, was not well suited to <quote>the playful elegance with which Hermione urges Polixenes</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 12 Nov. 1807) and conveyed <quote>too much of unbending and freezing dignity</quote> in the scene (<title level="j">Times</title>, 29 Nov. 1811). Her performance in the trial scene, in contrast, was praised for <quote>her indignation at the groundless charge</quote> (<title level="j">Daily Advertiser and Oracle</title>, 26 Mar. 1802) as well as for <quote>the eloquence of dignified and insulted innocence</quote> with which she defended herself (<title level="j">Morning Advertiser</title>, 12 Nov. 1807). Siddons is best remembered for the statue scene, in which she introduced Grecian drapery and pose and signaled that she was alive by suddenly moving her head when Paulina called for music to awaken her (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_boa1825"><name type="app">Boaden</name></ref>, 1825, 2:314).</p>

<p>Helena Faucit, the consummate Victorian Hermione and the most successful of Macready’s four Hermiones, was the first actress to win praise for all of Hermione’s scenes. She conveyed in 1.2 a <quote>confiding openness of disposition, frank in its spotless purity, and loving her lord so entirely that she loves nothing else but for his sake.</quote> When she rose to defend herself in the trial scene, she forgot <quote>all physical weakness in the earnestness of her emotion.</quote> As was Macready, Faucit was most celebrated in the statue scene: <quote>she descended from the pedestal, with a slow and gliding motion, and wearing the look of a being consecrated by long years of prayer and sorrow and seclusion</quote> (<title level="j">The Scotsman</title>, 3 Mar. 1847, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wills91"><name type="app">Williamson</name> &amp; <name type="app">Person</name></ref>, 1991, 15:411). Faucit’s innovative costume for this scene, which she describes in her 1 Nov. 1890 letter to Lord Tennyson (<title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Mag.</title>, Jan. 1891, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wils84"><name type="app">Williamson</name> &amp; <name type="app">Person</name></ref>, 1991, 15:414–15), dressed Hermione as a living queen, not a marble statue, unlike actresses since Siddons.</p>

<p>Warner introduced to New York (Burton’s Th., 1851) her <quote>Victorian interpretation [of Hermione], decorous and subdued</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 101). In the trial scene she conveyed <quote>physical weakness and moral power&hellip;injured innocence and gentlest submission to the hard decrees of fate</quote> (<title level="j">Albion</title>, 27 Sept. 1851, in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ode27"><name type="app">Odell</name></ref>, 1931, 6:124). Undeterred by her husband’s exhaustive historical research, Ellen Kean concealed layers of starched petticoats beneath her Grecian costume (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tere32"><name type="app">Terry</name></ref>, 1932, p. 15) and, as Faucit and Warner had done, modeled Hermione on an idealized Victorian heroine.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0024">In her memoirs Mary <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_andm1896"><name type="app">Anderson</name></ref> (1896, p. 244) recalls that she had sought <quote>to keep alive the sympathies of the audience with both Hermione and Perdita from beginning to end.</quote> Whereas Kemble, Macready, and Kean had added stage business to establish Leontes’s fondness for Mamillius, Anderson added business, such as Hermione’s greeting Mamillius with a kiss and Mamillius’s attempt to present her with flowers, to call attention to the affection shared by Hermione and her son (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 28). Anderson also reshaped the text to highlight Hermione’s plight and introduced stunning effects in the trial scene. Her Hermione crouched at the altar during the thunderstorm, and with a grand gesture covered her face with her cloak and collapsed at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1329">1329</ref> (<title level="j">Illustrated London News</title>, 17 Sept. 1887). The scene closed at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1389">1389</ref>, with Paulina moaning over the lifeless body of Hermione until the curtain dropped (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 28). The London critics, however, were not impressed by Anderson’s doubling of the mother and the daughter, which called more attention to the actor than to the roles, or by the unsatisfactory solution to the problem of presenting both characters in 5.3. Anderson simply cut Perdita’s lines and introduced a <quote>strange, veiled, speechless figure, who keeps her back to the audience and who is addressed as Perdita</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 12 Sept. 1887).</p>

<p>Freed from the visual tradition represented by Kean and seizing the option of playing a full text, 20th-c. directors gradually developed their own traditions. <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0026-a"/>Sicilian scenes were often set in winter, lighting effects frequently signaled the onset of Leontes’s jealousy, and visual images—such as Mamillius’s nursery toys and the bear—reinforced motifs explored by the production. Seeking a unifying device, some directors introduced characters such as the three gentlemen (5.2) or Time into several scenes; called attention to a phrase, such as <quote>A sad Tale’s best for Winter</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_618">618</ref>) or <quote>It is requir’d You doe awake your Faith</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3300" targetEnd="#tln_3301">3300–1</ref>); or created a dominant visual image, such as the change of seasons or the zodiacal signs.<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0026-b"/> Unlike the many directors who contrasted the dominant tones of Sicilia and Bohemia, some, such as Peter Hall (1988) and Adrian Noble (1992), stressed analagous themes and situations. By playing <title level="m">WT</title> in repertoire with other late Shn. works, artistic directors at the Royal Shakespeare Company (1969), the Stratford (Ont.) Shakespeare Festival (1986), and the National Theatre (1988) invited audiences to reexamine individual late plays in the broader context of Sh.’s other late plays. By relocating Sicilia to a society outside the typical audience’s experience, to a place such as a tribal court in the Arctic Circle (1976), directors seemed to suggest that Leontes’s jealousy was alien to the audience’s cultural norms. By locating the action near to the historical era or the geographical location of the audience, other directors, such as Terry Hands (1986), sought an immediacy of action for the emotionally charged issues. Several directors, most notably Robin Phillips (1978) and Hall (1988), questioned the reconciliation of Hermione and Leontes. In the second half of the 20th c. in productions such as David Thacker’s (Young Vic, 1991), Leontes’s private, domestic life overshadowed his public, royal role. As the century wore on, actresses playing Hermione, Paulina, and Perdita had the advantage of working with a fuller text than had their predecessors, whose lines had been reduced. By the end of the 20th c., <title level="m">WT</title> was firmly established in the theatrical canon.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0025">Working in the pictorial tradition of 19th-c. productions, Herbert Beerbohm Tree (His Majesty’s Th., 1906) staged a heavily cut script and reached <quote>the limits of spectacular realism&hellip;on the picture-frame stage</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 130). Unscripted stage business helped to establish location, such as springtime in Bohemia (4.3): Perdita sang at the cottage window; Florizel listened and threw her a posy; Autolycus awakened, hummed <quote>Will you buy</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2139" targetEnd="#tln_2144">2139–44</ref>), and washed in the stream; and the Clown entered leading a donkey to drink from the brook (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 35), which covered so much of the stage that it seems the <quote>merrymakers had chosen a somewhat inconvenient spot for their gambols</quote> (<title level="j">Tribune</title>, 3 Sept. 1906). Tree introduced three unifying devices: theme music for Perdita; theme music for interpolated allusions to Apollo as well as at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1312">1312</ref>; and additional thunder to mark the stages of Leontes’s jealousy (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, pp. 127, 130). Moreover, he took advantage of a special circumstance affecting his female lead. <quote>Ellen Terry made her theatrical debut as Mamillius in Charles Kean’s production of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> in 1856.&hellip; Tree hit upon the idea of having Miss Terry appear again&hellip;, this time in the role of Hermione.&hellip; Tree not only secured a star but created an occasion for his production</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_schma70"><name type="app">Schmitt</name></ref>, 1970, p. 21).</p>

<p>Six years later Harley Granville-Barker (Savoy Th., 1912) played almost a full text (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 139) and explored conventions of Renaissance staging. Granville-Barker altered the Savoy stage to create a platform with a discovery space and replaced the elaborate scenery and properties favored by the 19th c. with simple scene changes and minimal properties (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ken93"><name type="app">Kennedy</name>, 1993, pp. 71–3</ref>). Granville-Barker’s staging innovations allowed continuous action and encouraged an <quote>Elizabethan intimacy between actor and audience</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sty77"><name type="app">Styan</name></ref>, 1977, p. 83). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ken85"><name type="app">Kennedy</name></ref> (1985, p. 136) ranks the production <quote>as one of the four or five most important Shakespearian productions</quote> of the 20th century. Granville-Barker recognized the structural importance and stage-worthiness of small roles, such as those of the three gentlemen, whose lines had been reduced or reassigned in the 19th c. and whom he successfully restored (p. 133; <title level="j">Daily Chronicle</title>, 23 Sept. 1912); Time, who had sometimes been cut and sometimes, as in Kean’s production (1856), been part of an allegorical presentation; and the bear, which many 19th-c. productions had cut (see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0024-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0024-b"/>). The decor was simple: Norman Wilkinson designed two sets—the interior of Leontes’s palace and the exterior of the Old Shepherd’s cottage—and Albert Rothenstein <quote>painted drop curtains, which provided varying depths of stage, and which were suggestive of time and place but were not scenically realistic.</quote> Rothenstein’s eclectic costumes placed the play <quote>in the world of fancy, fantasy, and romance</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ken85"><name type="app">Kennedy</name></ref>, 1985, pp. 125, 128). Granville-Barker used traditional English music and authentic English country dances only when Sh. called for music or dance (<title level="j">Standard</title>, 21 Sept. 1912). Unlike 19th-c. producers, Granville-Barker directed <title level="m">WT</title> <quote>as a human drama concerning ordinary and not semi-heroic creatures</quote> (<title level="j">Westminster Gazette</title>, 23 Sept. 1912). For more on this production, see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dym86"><name type="app">Dymkowski</name></ref> (1986, pp. 39–45).</p>

<p>Directing the first major production after World War II, Anthony Quayle (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1948) owed more to Kean and Tree than to Granville-Barker. Quayle opened his 1.1 during the final moments of a <quote>sumptuous entertainment</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref>, 1965, no. 51) and closed the scene with <quote>a Kean-like Bacchanalia of barbaric intensity</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 203), played a heavily cut text, and closed with a procession and a song in praise of Apollo. A veteran of the Eastern European front, Quayle gave the Sicilian scenes a contemporary resonance by placing them behind the Iron Curtain and introducing a tyrannical ruler. Motley (Sophia Harris, Margaret F. Harris, and Elizabeth Montgomery) designed a blighted landscape and a dimly lit palace decorated with geometrical displays of spears, a celestial globe, and representations of supernatural creatures. The Bohemian scenes were set in the Cotswolds.</p>

<p>In the early 1950s two productions of <title level="m">WT</title> were part of a trend that sought to incorporate Elizabethan staging practices, such as fluid action, into performances of Sh. (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ven51a"><name type="app">Venezky</name></ref>, <title level="a">Productions,</title> 1951, p. 335). At the Comédie Française (1951) a <quote>simple, artistic setting of poles and curtains,</quote> rearranged to indicate change of place, kept <quote>the action in continuous flow</quote> (pp. 335, 337). Peter Brook’s landmark production (Phoenix Th., 1951) played on Sophie Fedorovitch’s set of <quote>modified upper and inner stages,</quote> which <quote>assure[d] continuous scenes</quote> (p. 335). Brook was influenced by, but made a number of significant departures from, Granville-Barker. For example, he used direct address <quote>sparingly</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 172), cut the text (pp. 170, 178), and read 5.3 as <quote>the truth of the play,</quote> not, like Granville-Barker, as a stage effect (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tre71"><name type="app">Trewin</name></ref>, 1971, p. 60). Brook’s staging of the transition from 3.3 to 4.2 was acclaimed: the highly effective storm on the seacoast of Bohemia turned into a heavy snowstorm, from which Time emerged. As he spoke, the storm abated and gave way to springtime (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeuz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 176; see also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ryl53"><name type="app">Rylands</name></ref>, 1953, p. 143, and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tre51b"><name type="app">Trewin</name></ref>, 1951).</p>

<p>On successive days in July 1958, productions in two quite different styles opened at summer festivals in Stratford, Connecticut, co-directed by John Houseman and Jack Landau, and in Stratford, Ontario, directed by Douglas Campbell. Houseman, seeking a style <quote>sufficiently formal to give the characters their fairy-tale quality, yet not so remote from life as to negate the human emotions,</quote> chose <quote>ancient semipolitical, semireligious symbols of the Mediterranean tarot card pack</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_hou83"><name type="app">Houseman</name></ref>, 1983, p. 140).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0022">Campbell’s version, with Tanya Moiseiwitsch’s Rubenesque costumes and props (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 187), included <quote>faint echoes of Charles Kean’s celebrated banquet</quote> (p. 185) and other business for which there is no textual basis (p. 188). To unify Acts 1–3 with 4–5, Campbell expanded the role of Time, who opened and closed the production and <quote>read several minor</quote> roles (<title level="j">Christian Century</title>, 29 Oct. 1958; see also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 188).</p>

<p>Peter Wood’s production (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1960) compared favorably with Brook’s, especially in regard to the strength of the casting of major roles, Wood’s attention to minor roles, and Jacques Noel’s <quote>uncluttered</quote> stage (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 31 Aug. 1960). Color—<quote>the red of passion, the purple of repentance, and the gold of celebration</quote>—marked three dominant moods of the production (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spe60"><name type="app">Speaight</name></ref>, 1960, p. 452). Presenting the three gentlemen (Ian Richardson, Roy Dotrice, and Peter Jeffery) as <quote>aged scholars,</quote> Wood expanded their parts to make them a unifying device; they were tutors to Mamillius and witnesses to Leontes’s accusation of Hermione and to her trial; one announced Mamillius’s death (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name>, 1982, pp. 204–5</ref>).</p>

<p>Trevor Nunn’s production (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1969) was one of the most influential of the late 20th c. Christopher Morley’s design, which broke with the tradition represented by the <quote>exquisite pictures</quote> of Wood and Noel, drew instead on the work of Granville-Barker (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, pp. 210, 212). Morley’s designs for the Sicilian scenes introduced one strong visual image, a three-sided white box representing Mamillius’s nursery, and two special effects, strobe lights and a rectangular box with mirrored walls. Dominating the sparsely furnished white box, an oversized hobby horse was used as a visual symbol at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_368">368</ref> (promptbook, SCL) and seemed <quote>symbolic both of innocence and lust</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spe69"><name type="app">Speaight</name></ref>, 1969, p. 437). <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0027-a"/>Other nursery toys assumed symbolic values when, for example, in 1.2 Mamillius and Leontes (Barrie Ingham) took turns peering through a kaleidoscope, and at the close of 1.2 Polixenes (Richard Pasco) played with a yo-yo (promptbook).<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0027-b"/> Strobe lights signaled the onset of Leontes’s jealousy, arrested the action, and forced the audience to <quote>see the blameless Hermione [Judi Dench] and Polixenes as they appear in the King’s feverish dream</quote> (<title level="j">New York Times</title>, 17 May 1969). The other special effect, the box, <quote>became a glittering symbol, reflecting light, linking the anguished Leontes, [who appeared within the box as] Time’s prisoner, and the cold statue,</quote> which was presented within it (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 213). By setting the Bohemian scenes in rural 1960s England, Nunn attempted, as had Frank Dunlop (Edinburgh, 1966; see also <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0023"/> below), to make Bohemia meaningful to contemporary audiences. Having cast Judi Dench as Hermione and as Perdita, he solved the technical problem in 5.3 by having Dench and her stand-in make a <quote>mechanical quick-change</quote> after <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3238">3238</ref> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 220). Anderson had solved the problem by cutting Perdita’s lines (see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0024"/>)</p>

<p>John Barton with Trevor Nunn (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1976) set <title level="m">WT</title> within the Arctic Circle. Having created an appropriate set, designer Di Seymour costumed Leontes and his subjects in <quote>Scandinavian furs and folk-woven materials, hot reds and oranges predominating</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr77"><name type="app">Warren</name></ref>, 1977, p. 173). The drapery featured <quote>strange signs resembling runes and figurative scenes, such as reindeer hunting</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lar76"><name type="app">Laroque</name></ref>, 1976, p. 91). The design concept did not easily accommodate the trial (3.2), which was staged in <quote>far too tribal and nomadic a court</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dav78"><name type="app">David</name></ref>, 1978, p. 224), and <quote>the shearing of sheep [which] was implausible in a landscape where no sheep could have pastured, and the flowers&hellip;would hardly have bloomed</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spe77a"><name type="app">Speaight</name></ref>, 1977, p. 188). The bear and Time were dominant motifs. Bears figured prominently in the decor; the bear (John Nettles) reappeared as Time, in effect <quote>transforming the bear into an allegory of Death and making Antigonus a victim of Time</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lar76"><name type="app">Laroque</name></ref>, 1976, p. 91); and <quote>the satyrs’ dance became a ritual hunt-ballet in which the main dancer was the bear</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 222).</p>

<p xml:id="para_0026">Among the productions that set <title level="m">WT</title> in a society familiar to late 20th-c. audiences are those by Robin Phillips and Adrian Noble. Seeking an autocratic period within the <quote>historical memory</quote> of their audiences (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_know85"><name type="app">R. P. Knowles</name></ref>, 1985, p. 26), Phillips and his designer, Daphne Dare (Stratford, Ont., 1978), placed Leontes’s court in Czarist Russia, 1880, and Bohemia in the Ukraine, 1896 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_know85"><name type="app">Knowles</name></ref>, 1985, p. 27). The Sicilian scenes revealed an uneasy relationship between Brian Bedford’s Leontes, a <quote>superbly repressed autocrat&hellip;[with] a festering passion,</quote> and <quote>Margot Dionne’s gracious Hermione,&hellip;composed yet suggesting pre-existent tensions between herself and Leontes</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berr79"><name type="app">Berry</name>, 1979, pp. 168–9</ref>). Phillips’s handling of 5.3 was <quote>superb with Hermione at first shrouded in darkness and gradually being illuminated through the lighting of innumerable candles</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 15 June 1978). Phillips made the reunion of Hermione and Leontes tentative and secondary to the reunion of Hermione and Perdita (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_berr79"><name type="app">Berry</name></ref>, 1979, p. 169). He cut <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3321" targetEnd="#tln_3322">3321–2</ref> and the match of Paulina and Camillo. Berry (p. 170) finds the result <quote>a fascinating design: but it is not precisely Shakespeare’s.</quote></p>

<p>For the RSC’s small-scale tour (UK, 1984; Poland, 1985), Adrian Noble set the Sicilian scenes in the <quote>frock-coated, bemeddaled [sic] world</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 12 Dec. 1984) of postwar Italy, and Bohemia in <quote>the raucous pop world of&hellip;Carnaby Street</quote> (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 22 Oct. 1984). The touring production played in venues ranging from a cattle shed to Lincoln Cathedral; with only limited seating available, most members of the audience were promenaders. Reviewers applauded Noble’s achievement. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rat84"><name type="app">Ratcliffe</name></ref> (1984): <quote>The apparently spontaneous tumble of players and punters produces confrontations and images which few who see them will quickly forget: Leontes in his anger ([Alun] Armstrong) scatters spectators to one side as he runs up the steps to poison the nursery calm; the messengers from Delphi (William Haden and Graham Turner) stand in light at the top of a sprawl of people, like immigrant survivors on a raft, stunned and humbled by the momentous nature of what they have just seen.</quote> At Lincoln Cathedral <quote>Hermione’s [trial] was breathtakingly staged, with the innocent queen and jealous king facing each other across half a mile of carpet cordoned off by officious ushers</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 27 Oct. 1984).</p>

<p>Two years later on the main stage at Stratford-upon-Avon, design overpowered Terry Hands’s production, which <quote>based its reading on the notion that political tyranny reenacts the egotism of a spoilt childhood</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shr87"><name type="app">Shrimpton</name></ref>, 1987, p. 177). Large polished panels upstage and a glass floor hazily reflected Leontes’s nursery-kingdom and, by also reflecting parts of the auditorium, seemed to transform the audience into subjects of the immature king. Hands drew on the productions of his RSC colleagues (Nunn, 1969, and Barton and Nunn, 1976) in, for example, the doubling of Hermione and Perdita (which Shrimpton, p. 178, finds <quote>pointless</quote>), the white Regency costumes, the wintry Sicilia, staging Sicilian scenes in a nursery, and introducing the bear as a design motif. But, especially in the use of the nursery and the bear, Hands <quote>paraded his theatrical devices and exaggerated the play’s <quote>theatrical self-consciousness</quote></quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr85"><name type="app">Warren</name></ref>, 1987, p. 86). Mamillius’s nursery floor was covered with an oversized bearskin, with head and flashing eyes; the bearskin was lifted dramatically to devour Antigonus; in Bohemia, Perdita and Florizel rested on it; Mamillius had a white teddy bear; Autolycus entered masquerading as a bear. Hands’s 1986 production was rethought and redesigned for London (Barbican Th., 1987), where it emphasized <quote>vanished innocence</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 16 Oct. 1987).</p>

<p>David William (Stratford, Ont., 1986) made design serve the script rather than compete with it, as Hands had done. Setting Sicilia in an 1830s European court and Bohemia in <quote>a Hardyesque rural community,</quote> he focused on the public and private relationships in those societies, not on <quote>period authenticity</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr87"><name type="app">Warren</name>, 1988, pp. 163, 165–6</ref>). William’s treatment of Leontes and Paulina was original. By directing Leontes as a weaker person than Polixenes, Hermione, or Paulina, William <quote>suggested a reason for Leontes’s sudden explosive insecurity</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wei87"><name type="app">Weil</name></ref>, 1987, p. 234).</p>

<p>With the same company of actors, Peter Hall staged <title level="m">WT</title>, <title level="m">Cym.</title>, and <title level="m">Tmp.</title> (National Th., 1988) on a permanent set evocative of a Jacobean indoor playhouse and in Carolingian costumes (design: Alison Chitty). Hall’s reading of <title level="m">WT</title> found a dark <quote>emotional unity that binds the two halves of the play together</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 20 May 1988). The onset of Leontes’s (Tim Pigott-Smith’s) jealousy altered other characters: <quote>Basil Henson’s&hellip;Camillo discovers his talent for deception. Peter Woodward’s boyish Polixenes loses his innocence in a flash&hellip;. Sally Dexter’s radiantly confident Hermione takes on an aloof dignity</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 20 May 1988). The <quote>revelry</quote> in Bohemia was <quote>astringent</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 20 May 1988). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel90"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref> (1990, p. 144): <quote>There was a wolfish menace in Ken Stott’s overloud Autolycus, contemptuous of those he fooled; an elaborate, ferocious dance of half-naked, phallus-bedecked satyrs brought before a scared Florizel [Steven Mackintosh] and Perdita [Shirley Henderson] an image of the wilder forces of nature and sexuality, and Polixenes’ angry disowning of Florizel visibly paralleled Leontes’ rejection of the baby Perdita.</quote></p>

<p>Hall’s staging of 5.3 reversed the usual stage picture: Hermione’s back was to the audience; Leontes and the court faced Hermione and the audience behind her. When Hermione turned, her face, <quote>lined with hurt as well as age,</quote> conveyed <quote>the cost of Leontes’ psychotic jealousy</quote> (<title level="j">Spectator</title>, 28 May 1988). The reunion of Hermione and Perdita was joyous; the reconciliation of Leontes and Hermione was extremely tentative.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0027">Luc Bondy’s production opened in Paris in April 1988 and played at the Avignon Festival in July (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lar88"><name type="app">Laroque</name>, 1988, pp. 97–9</ref>). Leontes (Michel Piccoli) and Polixenes (Bernard Ballet) were not matched physically, were approaching 50, and gave a <quote>sinister, hollow ring</quote> to their memories of boyhood (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_camc90"><name type="app">Campos</name>, 1990, pp. 41–2</ref>). Three years later Bondy’s <quote>magnificent new production</quote> (Berlin, 1991) of Peter Handke’s translation contrasted an <quote>orderly</quote> Sicily, its architecture characterized by <quote>harsh angles,</quote> with <quote>the dreamy disorder of Bohemia</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 3 Jan. 1991). Costumes and set were contemporary. In a variation of the theme struck by Phillips and Hall, 5.3 returned Hermione <quote>to a world irremediably poisoned by the events of 16 years before and to a husband who has lost the capacity to give and receive love</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 3 Jan. 1991).</p>

<p>With a company of 14, David Thacker (Young Vic, 1991) staged a small-scale, minimalist production in the round and stripped Leontes of the accoutrements of absolute monarchy. He had <quote>no court, no system of power, no trappings of authority</quote> (<title level="j">Plays and Players</title>, Nov. 1991, p. 31). Sheelagh Keegan’s sunken circle within a larger circle—a spare, flexible set—provided a visual counterpoint to the embrace of Leontes and Polixenes at the opening and of Hermione and Leontes at the close (<title level="j">Spectator</title>, 14 Sept. 1991) and to the <quote>tight family circle</quote> (<title level="j">Sunday Telegraph</title>, 22 Sept. 1991).</p>

<p>Théâtre de Complicité, a British touring company whose earliest work was the staging of company-devised plays, selected <title level="m">WT</title> for its second text-based production. Complicité incorporated images familiar from recent productions (a desolate, wintry Sicily; Mamillius’s nursery toys). Its methods drew enthusiastic reviews, such as Paul Taylor’s praise of its enactment of unscripted scenes: <quote>I have never, for example, seen the transition from pastoral Bohemia back to the wintry penitential world of Leontes’ Sicilia effected as magically or as arrestingly as here. Holding model galleons aloft, the people making the trip start a progress round the stage. Then, snow starts to fall and, as this is a production where the actors play more than one role, the group of travellers slowly transforms itself, before your very eyes, into the funereal procession that trudges after Leontes in his daily circuits of repentance. It’s a haunting, unforgettable sequence</quote> (<title level="j">Independent</title>, 4 Apr. 1992; see also <title level="j">Independent</title>, 2 Mar. 1994).</p>

<p>Noble set his second production for the RSC (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1992) in <quote>some nonspecific, early-twentieth-century aristocratic world</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sma92"><name type="app">Smallwood</name></ref>, 1993, p. 349) and stressed, as Hall had done, an <quote>emotional unity</quote> binding the two halves of the play. Unlike Hall, Noble celebrated an emotional warmth in the reconciliation of Hermione (Samantha Bond) and Leontes (John Nettles) and Polixenes (Paul Jesson) and a communal warmth in the sheepshearing scenes, staged as a village fête reminiscent of Stanley Spencer’s Cookham.</p>

<p xml:id="para_0028">With a company of 10, Stéphane Braunschweig (Centre Dramatique National Orléons-Loiret, Edinburgh Festival, 1994) <quote>opt[ed] throughout for minimalist austerity</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 25 Aug. 1994). He brought out the private, not the public, effects of Leontes’s jealousy (<title level="j">Guardian</title>) and made <quote>the scenery itself [design: Giorgio Barberio Corsetti] a symbol of the play’s often distorted emotional perspectives</quote> (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 25 Aug. 1994). Hermione appeared in 3.3, remained on stage, and became Time. In 5.3 <quote>the dead Mamillius’s tunic hangs in silent reminder of just what has been destroyed, the resurrected queen and her reunited king intone their ostensibly joyous lines in halting monotone: no happy ending, but an intimation that life goes on, at bitter cost</quote> (<title level="j">Scotsman</title>, 25 Aug. 1994). Although it was often perceptive and ingenious, reviewers found that the production lacked <quote>imaginative sympathy</quote> (<title level="j">Sunday Telegraph</title>, 28 Aug. 1994).</p>

<p>Ingmar Bergman (Royal Dramatic Theatre of Sweden, 1994) staged <title level="m">WT</title> as a play within a play. By staging his production on a set that mirrored the shape of the auditorium (design: Lennart Mork) and by placing an audience on stage, Bergman attempted to break down the barrier between stage and auditorium, between actor and audience (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tor95"><name type="app">Törnqvist</name>, 1995, pp. 83–5</ref>). Lighting indicated the stages in Leontes’s <quote>inner development. When his jealousy was kindled, the windows were lit deep red. Later, when his love for Hermione had died, or rather lay dormant, a cold winter night with a starry sky and a frosty moon above snow-clad trees could be glimpsed outside the windows</quote> (p. 85). The play and the play within the play had a Christian frame of reference. For example, Bergman set 5.1 in a cloister and made Leontes a flagellant (p. 89). As the statue, Hermione lay on a catafalque (p. 90).</p>

<p>For Method and Madness’s small-scale tour (Lyric Th., Hammersmith, 1997) director Mike Alfreds relied on effective doubling by his cast of eight, an uncluttered set, and minimal props, music, and sound effects. The production opened with Mamillius (Fergus O’donnell) announcing <quote>A sad Tale’s best for Winter</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_618">618</ref>) as behind him <quote>the actors [were] literally cloaking themselves in the world of the play, dressing each other in simply-draped coloured cloths edged in fur</quote> (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 16 June 1997).</p>

<p>For the inaugural season of Sh.’s Globe (1997) director David Freeman and designer Tom Phillips, R.A., set <title level="m">WT</title> in an African society that worshipped primitive deities. Leontes’s (Mark Lewis Jones’s) throne and one permanent prop, the <quote>shrine,</quote> to which characters made obeisance, were constructed from abandoned tractor tires (aid from the UN?). Freeman introduced black magic, practiced chiefly by Paulina, and made anger, expressed by shouting and eruption into uncivil—and unscripted—behavior, the predominant tone.</p>

<p>In 20th-c. productions of <title level="m">WT</title>, especially those in which directors played a fairly full text and collaborated with their designers on a controlling concept, performances are best seen in relation to other aspects of the production. In the case of Leontes, for example, performances by Esmond Knight (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1948) and Jeremy Irons (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1986) were complemented by the stage picture; performances by Barrie Ingham (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1969), Ian McKellen (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1976), Borje Ahlstedt (Sweden, 1994), and others were indebted to the lighting designer; and other performances, such as Colm Feore’s (Stratford, Ont., 1986), are best understood in context with, in Feore’s case, the decision to play Leontes as weaker than Polixenes, Hermione, and Paulina. In these and other productions, actors had, of course, to decide how best to convey the source and expression of Leontes’s jealousy.</p>

<p>Henry Ainley (Savoy Th., 1912) broke with the tradition of making Leontes dignified, noble. Blurring some of Leontes’s sentences, Ainley conveyed <quote>the King’s fevered, irrational, or&hellip;neurotic mood and temperament</quote> (<title level="j">The Nation</title>, 28 Sept. 1912). Ainley’s <quote>displays of physical frenzy,</quote> which were <quote>fascinatingly ugly&hellip;powerful, rather horrible,</quote> and his <quote>disagreeable-looking</quote> appearance made it possible to understand why it had taken Lillah McCarthy’s Hermione three months to <quote>make up her mind</quote> and why <quote>in the Statue scene she exhibited a comparative coldness</quote> (<title level="j">Westminster Gazette</title>, 23 Sept. 1912).</p>

<p>Well suited to the Eastern European design of Quayle’s production (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1948), <quote>Esmond Knight’s full-voiced and passionate Leontes</quote> (<title level="j">Birmingham Evening Despatch</title>, 5 June 1948) possessed a <quote>mind wholly distorted by his strange obsession</quote> (<title level="j">Leamington Spa Courier</title>, 11 June 1948). The tradition of playing Leontes <quote>as a man singled out for destruction by a power outside himself</quote> was continued at, for example, Stratford, Ont.

In a performance (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1960) that, according to some reviewers, matched the acting standards set by Gielgud, Eric Porter’s <quote>self-pitying</quote> Leontes (<title level="j">Yorkshire Post</title>, 31 Aug. 1960) was <quote>a sick man,&hellip;his mind racing with the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">tremor cordis</foreign> that finds its natural expression in the feverishly disjointed verse</quote> (<title level="j">Observer</title>, 4 Sept. 1960).</p>

<p>In Ian McKellen’s (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1976) <quote>exquisitely sensitive reading</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dav78"><name type="app">David</name></ref>, 1978, p. 223), Leontes <quote>suddenly switche[d] from demonic tyranny&hellip;to the pathos of a man destroyed by his own sexual fantasies</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 5 June 1976). In contrast with McKellen’s Scandinavian <quote>fairy prince spell-struck</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dav78"><name type="app">David</name></ref>, 1978, p. 223), Alun Armstrong’s 1950s Sicilian Leontes (RSC tour, 1984) had a <quote>craggy, raw-edged emotional directness</quote> (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 13 Dec. 1984). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_rat84"><name type="app">Ratcliffe</name></ref> (1984): <quote>It is terrible to watch Mr Armstrong weep, because he does not look the weeping kind</quote> (<title level="j">Observer</title>, 16 Dec. 1984).</p>

<p>Jeremy Irons (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1986) and Paul Shelley, who replaced Irons when the production was transferred to London (Barbican Th., 1987), offered two different interpretations. Irons’s Leontes, <quote>a monster of the nursery, a fractious brat whose jealousy expressed itself in tears and tantrums,&hellip;spoke&hellip;with infantile exaggeration</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shr87"><name type="app">Shrimpton</name></ref>, 1987, p. 177) and, seeking laughter, turned <title level="m">WT</title> into <quote>a trivial domestic comedy in which adultery was a topic for smutty jokes</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr85"><name type="app">Warren</name></ref>, 1987, p. 86). Shelley played <quote>a tortured fantasist who both dreams of his wife’s adultery and is haunted by a memory of some idyllic, sexless past</quote> (<title level="j">Guardian</title>, 16 Oct. 1987).</p>

<p>Tim Pigott-Smith (National Th., 1988) played <quote>the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">tremor cordis</foreign>&hellip;and the twinges of his jealousy [as] a physical symptom, recurring later in the action at moments of especial stress</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel90"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>, 1990, p. 144). Insecure, Leontes teased and bullied courtiers, sought reassurance from the audience, and allowed Paulina (Eileen Atkins) to scold him and, later, to comfort him.</p>

<p>In Bondy’s first production of <title level="m">WT</title> (Paris, 1988), Michel Piccoli’s middle-aged Leontes <quote>quickly</quote> established an <quote>oddness</quote> in which <quote>everything he says can be dangerous</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_camc90"><name type="app">Campos</name></ref>, 1990, p. 43). Three years later (Berlin, 1991) the Leontes of Hans Christian Rudolph, whose <quote>jealousy [was] a physical pain burning his heart</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 3 Jan. 1991), recalled Pigott-Smith’s performance.</p>

<p>Simon McBurney’s <quote>brilliant and unnerving</quote> Leontes (Théâtre de Complicité, 1992) <quote>was impossible for the audience comfortably to control and pigeon-hole. Unquestionably a tyrant, this Leontes could be turned by the deaths of his son and queen into a twitching heap with staring eyes, demanding Paulina’s tenderness as well as her ferocity, exiting to great shouts of <quote>sorrows</quote></quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1435">1435</ref>; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_holp94"><name type="app">Holland</name></ref>, 1994, p. 171).</p>

<p>At Stratford-upon-Avon in 1992 Leontes’s (John Nettles’s) jealousy sprang from his misreading of Hermione’s innocent sensuousness. <quote>In a series of freezes of the others [in 1.2], he hovered round the fringes of the group, an isolated and furtive figure, peeping and spying and sharing his desperate imaginings with the audience in a dislocated, clipped, staccato delivery, with angry changes of rhythm surging through the lines, a delivery that seemed&hellip;highly effective in suggesting a mind almost audibly cracking up</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sma92"><name type="app">Smallwood</name></ref>, 1993, p. 349).</p>

<p>Especially in the first half of the century, actresses playing Hermione followed in the 19th-c. tradition. Ellen Terry (His Majesty’s Th., 1906), who had played Mamillius in Kean’s production (1856), distinguished <quote>between [Hermione’s] deep, passionate love for Leontes and her frank comradeship for Polixenes</quote> (<title level="j">Morning Post</title>, 3 Sept. 1906; see <ptr targType="p" target="#para_0025"/>). When accused of adultery, Terry’s Hermione was <quote>heart-broken, and&hellip;made it seem that she was sorely grieved that [Leontes’s] mind was thrown out of balance</quote> (<title level="j">Daily News</title>, 3 Sept. 1906). Diana Wynyard (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1948), who with Ena Burrill (Paulina) introduced a civilizing tone to Quayle’s barbaric Eastern European Sicilia, evoked reviews similar to those given 19th-c. actresses; she portrayed, for example, <quote>the dignity of a gracious goddess&hellip;[and] the rich humanity of a wife and mother</quote> (<title level="j">Stage</title>, 10 June 1948). Wynyard gave a similar interpretation when she repeated the role in Brook’s production (Phoenix Th., 1951).</p>

<p>A number of 20th-c. productions questioned the nature of the reconciliation of Hermione and Leontes. In 5.3 Lillah McCarthy’s Hermione (Savoy Th., 1912) <quote>exhibited a comparative coldness. Indeed, Camillo’s phrase <quote>She hangs about his neck</quote> [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3322">3322</ref>] was hardly realised in the acting</quote> (<title level="j">Westminster Gazette</title>, 23 Sept. 1912). Breaking her pose as the statue, Sally Dexter’s Hermione (National Th., 1988) <quote>moved forward unsmiling.&hellip; There was a world of unspoken emotion between husband and wife as, left alone together, they sombrely joined hands again</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel90"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>, 1990, p. 144). Productions including Stratford, Ont., 1978; Berlin, 1991; and Edinburgh, 1994, also reunited a dysfunctional couple. (see above, <ptr mode="listFirst" targType="p" target="#para_0026"/>, <ptr mode="list" targType="p" target="#para_0027"/>, <ptr mode="list" targType="p" target="#para_0028"/>.)</p>

<p>In other productions Hermione provided a motive for Leontes’s jealousy. Penny Downie (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1986) was an <quote>exceptionally flirtatious and ingratiating</quote> Hermione, and Paul Greenwood’s Polixenes <quote>lavished cuddles, back-rubs, and love-lorn gazes upon her</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shr87"><name type="app">Shrimpton</name></ref>, 1987, p. 178). When the production was transferred (Barbican Th., 1987), Downie’s Hermione and Martin Jacobs’s Polixenes gave Leontes no cause for jealousy but did, nevertheless, suggest that <quote>had things been different, these two might have loved each other with all the reckless carnal passion of which they are falsely accused</quote> (<title level="j">Plays and Players</title>, Feb. 1988, p. 21). Bulle Ogier’s Hermione (Paris, 1988) provoked Leontes’s jealousy, and at times her <quote>almost exaggeratedly pure</quote> Hermione seemed to be drawn to Ballet’s unattractive Polixenes (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_camc90"><name type="app">Campos</name>, 1990, pp. 42–3</ref>).</p>

<p>Exploring many aspects of Hermione’s character, Judi Dench (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1969) was <quote>a bewitching queen, as rare and precious as the text suggests, with a tart wit which gives way&hellip;to a sombre strength and dignity</quote> (<title level="j">Spectator</title>, 23 May 1969). Many recent depictions have called attention to Hermione’s human qualities rather than her regal status. They include Marilyn Taylerson’s (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1976), Lynn Farleigh’s (RSC tour, 1984), and Samantha Bond’s (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1992).</p>

<p>In the 20th c. Paulina has most often been presented as a woman whose admirable strength tempers Leontes. Brook (Phoenix Th., 1951) directed Flora Robson to play her <quote>as a force for sanity in the insane world created by Leontes</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 173). Eileen Herlie’s (Stratford, Ont., 1958) Paulina was a <quote>fearless woman of moral passion</quote> (<title level="j">New York Times</title>, 23 July 1958). Peggy Ashcroft (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1960) <quote>seemed to combine an iron strength of character with mature grace and sweetness</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 209). Brenda Bruce (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1969), who portrayed a <quote>practical, witty great lady,</quote> was succeeded when the show was transferred (Aldwych Th., 1970) by Elizabeth Spriggs, who <quote>gave Paulina a spiritual dimension</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref>, 1982, p. 217). Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1976) was <quote>triumphantly forceful</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dav78"><name type="app">David</name></ref>, 1978, p. 224). Janet Dale’s (RSC tour, 1984) <quote>notable Paulina, elegant and beautifully spoken</quote> (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 22 Oct. 1984) gave a <quote>thrilling denunciation of Leontes</quote> (<title level="j">Times</title>, 27 Oct. 1984) but was also <quote>good-hearted</quote> (<title level="j">Financial Times</title>, 13 Dec. 1984). Eileen Atkins’s (National Th., 1988) strong, compassionate Paulina also guided Leontes’s penance. Other treatments departed from the dominant one. The <quote>near-crazed grief</quote> of Susan Wright’s (Stratford, Ont., 1986) Paulina after Hermione fainted indicated <quote>that she thought Hermione dead.&hellip; Moved by his [Leontes’s] genuine anguish, she decided then and there to help him</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr87"><name type="app">Warren</name></ref>, 1988, p. 166). Instead of aiding Leontes, Gemma Jones’s (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1992) bossy Paulina, <quote>a county lady&hellip;forever doing good works and opening bazaars, [who] was far from the moral power the text can reveal</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_holp94"><name type="app">Holland</name></ref>, 1994, p. 175), seemed to leave Leontes to draw on his own inner resources. At another extreme (Paris, 1988), Leontes and Paulina (Nada Strancar) were <quote>manipulators, falsifiers, showmen, at opposite ends of the play</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_camc90"><name type="app">Campos</name></ref>, 1990, p. 43).</p>


<div type="level3" xml:id="div_perf_bearandtime">
<head>Staging the Bear and Time</head>

<p>The bear, restored by Kemble in 1802, asks two major questions of the director: what effect should the bear create and how should the effect be achieved? On theatrical bears in Sh.’s time, see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_1436">1500</ref>. Nineteenth-century promptbooks and theater reviews yield little information about staging the bear. In the 20th c. bears have been frightening (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1969; <title level="j">Spectator</title>, 23 May 1969); <quote>ludicrous</quote> (Chicago, 1994; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_brad95"><name type="app">Brailow</name></ref>, 1995, p. 15); humorous (New York, 1985; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_deim85"><name type="app">Deiter</name></ref>, 1985); <quote>pantomime-type</quote> (St. George’s Th., 1980; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pea81"><name type="app">Pearce</name></ref>, 1981, p. 130; and Young Vic Th., 1981; <title level="j">Guardian</title>, 27 Nov. 1981); and even cuddly (Alabama, 1976; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kay77"><name type="app">Kay</name></ref>, 1977, p. 221). Technical effects have evoked the bear: shadows (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1960; <title level="j">Illustrated London News</title>, 17 Sept. 1960); noise and thunder (Young Vic, 1991; <title level="j">Spectator</title>, 14 Sept. 1991). Human bears have appeared as an unclear, muffled figure (San Diego, 1963; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_proe63"><name type="app">Prosser</name></ref>, 1963, p. 447); in running shorts and track shoes (Venice Beach, Calif., 1979; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stoj80"><name type="app">Stodder</name> &amp; <name type="app">Wilds</name></ref>, 1980, p. 267); and in a dancer’s practice clothes (Washington, D.C., 1987; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_toc87"><name type="app">Tocci</name></ref>, 1987, p. 10). The bear has been a symbolic feature (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1986; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr85"><name type="app">Warren</name></ref>, 1987, p. 86), and has been presaged by Mamillius’s teddy bear (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1969; promptbook, SCL; and 1986, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fuz86"><name type="app">Fuzier</name> &amp; <name type="app">Maguin</name></ref>, 1986, p. 94). Bears have been diverted from Perdita by Antigonus (Oregon, 1984; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_desa85"><name type="app">Dessen</name>, 1985, pp. 604–5</ref>) and by Hermione (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1992; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sma92"><name type="app">Smallwood</name></ref>, 1993, p. 350). By augmentation of the fur on Leontes’s costume, the BBC (1980) linked Leontes with the bear (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pea81"><name type="app">Pearce</name></ref>, 1981, p. 98). At Sh.’s Globe Th. (1997) <quote>Hermione, who [had] been hovering in spirit over the abandoned Perdita,</quote> drew on claws and became the bear (<title level="j">Times</title>, 6 June 1997).</p>

<p>Although some directors treat the Chorus simply or reassign the lines to another character, such as Camillo (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1992; promptbook, SCL), others have used Sh.’s choric figure to explore themes and motifs. At Stratford, Ont., 1958, Campbell, whose production examined the importance of Time to <quote>the repentance of the sinner and the return of the lost,</quote> expanded the role of Chorus by introducing Time into some scenes as a silent participant and into other scenes as the speaker of a minor role (<title level="j">Christian Century</title>, 29 Oct. 1958, p. 1240). In other productions the role has been expanded either by absorbing other parts, such as Archidamus, gaoler, mariner, and the bear (Birmingham, 1986; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coc87"><name type="app">Cochrane</name></ref>, 1987, p. 90) or by introducing Time as a silent witness or participant: Schenectady, N.Y., and Williamstown, Mass., 1981 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_litt82"><name type="app">Littlefield</name></ref>, 1982, p. 207); Washington, D.C., 1987 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_toc87"><name type="app">Tocci</name></ref>, 1987, p. 9); Boston, 1987 (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bigm88"><name type="app">Biggs</name></ref>, 1988, p. 20). Time has been an <quote>unsuitably resurrected</quote> Mamillius (New York, 1985; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_alt85"><name type="app">Alter</name> &amp; <name type="app">Long</name></ref>, 1985, p. 22); a gardener (Complicité, 1992; <title level="j">Independent on Sunday</title>, 5 Apr. 1992); a young cricketer (Chicago, 1994; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_brad95"><name type="app">Brailow</name></ref>, 1995, p. 15); and a foreshadowing of Autolycus (Sh.’s Globe Th., 1997), with whom he was doubled. Entering from the Globe’s yard, Time (Nicholas Le Prevost), a cider-swilling beggar, engaged the audience and sought help onto the platform. Time has stage-managed dumbshows (Los Angeles, 1981), <quote>spotlighting each character he mentions</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wil82"><name type="app">Wilds</name></ref>, 1982, p. 388); has given some of his lines to other members of the company (Method and Madness, 1997); has participated in a masque as <quote>a carnival monster&hellip;[which] gave birth to the child Mamillius</quote> (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1981; <title level="j">Times</title>, 1 July 1981, p. 13); and has appeared <quote>to some extent a baroque allegorical figure, flying on in flapping, fluffy wings</quote> (Stratford-upon-Avon, 1986; <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warrr85"><name type="app">Warren</name></ref>, 1987, p. 86).</p>

<head>The Text on the Stage</head>

<p>Productions of <title level="m">WT</title>, like those of Sh.’s other plays, reflect tastes, biases, and interpretive ideas of actors, directors, managers, and critics and their times. Susceptible to these fluctuating ideas, the play in some versions has been reshaped quite freely. Alterations have been made by cutting, adding, transposing, and substituting.</p>

<div type="level3" xml:id="div_textonstage_versions">
<head>The Versions</head>

<p>This survey analyzes theatrical texts of <title level="m">WT</title> in acting versions, typescripts marked as promptbooks, some actors’ partbooks, and preparation copies used in production, primarily those listed in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shat65"><name type="app">Shattuck</name></ref> (1965, pp. 495–506), with some additions. Omitted from discussion are incomplete promptbooks and partbooks, some duplicates of versions included in the survey, and versions that were not staged (Shattuck nos. 1–4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15–17, 19, 20, 22–7, 29–31, 36–8, 40, 41, 44, 45, 54). Several adaptations are also omitted from consideration: Charles Marsh’s (1756), as <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1898"><name type="app">Furness</name></ref> (ed. 1898, p. 413) notes, <quote>is a gallimaufry of the original, and as it was never acted,&hellip;I think we can dismiss it without lasting regret or more space</quote>; Macnamara Morgan’s adaptation (1762) bears little resemblance to Sh.’s play and had no influence on subsequent productions of <title level="m">WT</title>; the adaptation by George Colman the Elder (1777) draws as heavily on Garrick as on Sh. By contrast, Garrick’s extremely popular abridgment, <title level="m">Florizel and Perdita</title>, is given a place in this survey because it influenced subsequent productions. The following are the versions analyzed:

<p>Anderson’s partbook, created for Macready’s production at Covent Garden, 30 Sept. 1837, illustrates Macready’s debt to <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> through the many virtually identical duplications in Anderson’s hand of handwritten prompt markings by <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_5">Kemble that appear in no. 5</ref>.

[Shattuck no. 10; Folger Library, WT 14.]</p>
<p>In using the <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_6">Cumberland</ref> text, Phelps perpetuates the basic <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3">Kemble acting version (no. 3)</ref>, particularly its handling of the roles of Leontes and Perdita.

<p>Pages cut from Charles Knight, <title level="m">The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakspere, Comedies</title> [1841], 2:333–93, and bound in a brown paper cover serve as preparation copy for this production.

<p>This printed acting ed. cuts fewer lines than the preparation copy <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10">(no. 10)</ref> for the same production. SDs are exceptionally detailed, fleshing out for the reader Kean’s conception of a Greek setting and describing his elaborate presentation of Time. <title level="j">Punch</title> (17 May 1856) comments that Kean never allows the play to get in the way of spectacle, <quote>the so-called poetry being cut down to the scantiest dimensions, and delivered with the utmost rapidity, and with no intrusive attempt at acting.</quote> Some of the alterations to Florizel’s part may be attributed to Kean’s decision to use an actress in the role.

<p>The preface to Anderson’s acting ed. of <title level="m">WT</title>, as produced at Palmer’s Theater, New York, 14 Nov. 1888, claims fidelity to F as far as possible but argues that the needs of the stage and demands of modern tastes make large excisions unavoidable; in fact, <quote>a literal adhesion to the text as it has been handed down to us would&hellip;savour of superstition.</quote> A number of alterations can be attributed to decisions she had previously made about the text for her 1887 season in London.

New York: McClure, Phillips &amp; Co., 1905.</p>
<p>Vernon’s production notes explain that Allen curtailed her text only after <quote>consulting the opinions of eminent English and American scholars</quote> (p. vii). She alters the sequence of a few scenes and abandons Greek costume and settings in favor of Byzantine ones in an effort to eliminate anachronisms. Vernon admits no indebtedness to <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson (no. 14)</ref>, but clearly it exists: Allen doubles Perdita and Hermione and adopts many of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref>’s other changes, including the altered conclusion.</p></item>

<p>Allen’s acting ed. differs slightly from <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson’s (no. 14)</ref> but further changes in this promptbook eliminate many of those differences, making <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> and Allen virtually identical.</p></item>

<p>Corbin (the stage manager) and Ames both contributed to the final form of the promptbook. Corbin’s cuts and other changes often follow <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_11">Kean (no. 11)</ref>.

<p>This book reflects the production that opened at the Savoy Theatre, London, on 21 Sept. 1912. Convinced that every Elizabethan play should be delivered as swiftly and uninterruptedly as possible, Granville-Barker divides the play into two parts. He eliminates act and scene designations from this edition, adds and alters sparingly, and cuts only 20 lines (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_wel67"><name type="app">Wells</name></ref>, <quote>Modern Stage,</quote> 1967, p. 177), making this, according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_dym86"><name type="app">Dymkowski</name></ref> (1986, p. 44), <quote>probably the first performance in England of a play by Shakespeare that the author could himself have recognized for his own.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_tre64"><name type="app">Trewin</name></ref> (1964, p. 54) cites an admirer of this version: <quote>It must electrify people to find that a Shakespeare play makes sense when not gutted of vital parts.</quote> The play was nonetheless <quote>withdrawn</quote> after six weeks.</p></item>

<p>A note (p. 1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>) says that Woolfe prepared his version <quote>using the 1931 prompt book for the [William] Bridges-Adams production</quote> (not available at the Sh.

<p>Payne creates a subtly altered text by changing single lines and phrases rather than complete speeches or scenes. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref> notes: <quote>The main lines of interpretation, the cuts in the text, do not appear to have changed much between Stratford and New York [see no. 21]</quote> (p. 202).

<p>Not merely a duplicate of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_20">no. 20</ref>, though they often correspond, this version has many affinities with <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, particularly in its cuts, the most obvious of which is of Perdita’s debate with Polixenes, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref> notes (p. 169).</p></item>

<item n="22" xml:id="item_009_22"><p>Quayle: A copy of an unidentified Sh. ed. marked for Anthony Quayle’s promptbook of the Memorial Theatre production, Stratford-upon-Avon, 4 June 1948. [Shattuck no. 51; Sh. Centre Library 71.21/1948W.]</p>
<p>Quayle adds nothing, alters just once, but cuts about 975 lines. According to stage manager Robert Gaston, Quayle’s production on 25 Oct. 1948 ran 2 hours 50 minutes, nearly the same playing time given for the <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_17">Ames (no. 17)</ref> version.</p></item>

<p>Wood’s cuts are moderate, his substitutions and alterations sparing. A few changes are independent of other versions; those that are not indicate no reliance on any single earlier text.</p></item>

<p>Nunn rearranges lines in the sheepshearing scene and occasionally substitutes synonyms for words that could be unclear to an audience. Like <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson (no. 14)</ref>, he doubles Hermione and Perdita, though he <quote>had no idea that the doubling had been done by Mary Anderson at the end of the nineteenth century.</quote> Where her production devised a successful, if not critically pleasing, strategy for accommodating both characters on stage in the last scene, Nunn’s did not, according to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bart82"><name type="app">Bartholomeusz</name></ref> (p. 219).</p></item>

<item n="25" xml:id="item_009_25"><p>Barton: A copy of Wilson’s New [Cambridge] Ed. (1959) marked for John Barton’s promptbook of his and Trevor Nunn’s Royal Sh. Theatre production, Stratford-upon-Avon, 1 June 1976. [Not in Shattuck; Sh. Centre Library 71.21/1976W.]</p>
<p>One might expect this text to be a simple replication of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_24">Nunn (no. 24)</ref>, but it is not. Barton, for example, does not double Hermione and Perdita, nor does he rearrange lines in the sheepshearing scene according to <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_24">Nunn</ref>. He makes a number of independent changes.</p></item>

The book was also used in 1982 at both the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, and the Barbican. [Not in Shattuck; Sh. Centre Library 71.21/1981W.]</p>
<p>Eyre cuts and substitutes moderately, reorders lines in the sheepshearing scene (though not according to <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_24">Nunn</ref>), and occasionally replaces words or phrases that could seem obscure to an audience. He does not perpetuate the doubling of Hermione and Perdita. His text reflects no single early version throughout, but he does duplicate <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson’s (no. 14)</ref> unusual cut of the Clown’s comic description of the deaths of Antigonus and the Mariners.</p></item>

<p>Hands cuts, alters, and substitutes sparingly. He revives the doubling of Hermione and Perdita and makes a few independent alterations.</p></item>

<p>While <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_18">Granville-Barker</ref> comes close, no production of <title level="m">WT</title> fully meets <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_shag19 #b_shag61"><name type="app">Shaw</name></ref>’s (1919; 1961, pp. 267–8) challenge to present any Sh. play in its original version, thereby making <quote>Shakespear, and not the producer, the ultimate authority,</quote> since <quote>experience remorselessly proves that Shakespear making a fool of himself is more [<hi rend="italic">268</hi>] interesting than the judicious producer correcting him.</quote> After <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref>’s adaptation, structural change begins with the reduction of F’s five acts (retained from <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> through <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref>) to four acts in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_15 #item_009_16">Allen (nos. 15 and 16)</ref> and two in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_18">Granville-Barker</ref> and succeeding versions. F’s 15 scene divisions are completely eliminated in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_18">Granville-Barker</ref>. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> has eight scenes, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_22">Quayle</ref> eleven, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_23">Wood</ref> thirteen, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> and derivative versions fourteen. Only two scenes (3.1 [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1145" targetEnd="#tln_1172">1145–72</ref>] and 4.1 [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1579" targetEnd="#tln_1611">1579–1611</ref>], <quote>Delphos</quote> and <quote>Time</quote>) are ever omitted entirely, and no version omits both. Scenes are transposed, as are smaller units. Verbal substitutions usually occur when diction seems offensive or unclear. Additions are rare. Cutting of blocks of dialogue and thinning (removing words or lines within speeches, presumably to make the text more accessible and more intelligible) are the means most often used to shape the play. Alterations are prompted by everything from the supposed indecency and incoherence of the text to the leading lady’s doubling the roles of Hermione and Perdita to the presumption that brevity and speed of action will please the audience.</p>

<p>Most productions of <title level="m">WT</title> have some affinity with others, but many are independent artistic efforts and get independent treatment here. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref>’s adaptation of <title level="m">WT</title> (<title level="m">Florizel and Perdita</title>) is a special case: it is the source of some significant alterations that are cited when other productions adopt them. Since <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_18">Granville-Barker</ref>’s version stages nearly the whole text, unless it is specifically mentioned below it reads with F. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3">Kemble (no. 3)</ref> is the direct ancestor of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_4">Inchbald (no. 4)</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_5">Kemble (no. 5)</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_6">Cumberland (no. 6)</ref> and, through <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_4">Inchbald</ref> or <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_6">Cumberland</ref>, of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_7">Macready (no. 7)</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_8">Phelps (no. 8)</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_9">Burton (no. 9)</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_12">French (no. 12)</ref>. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10">Kean (no. 10)</ref> is the direct ancestor of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_11">Kean (no. 11)</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson (no. 14)</ref> of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_15 #item_009_16">Allen (nos. 15, 16)</ref>. Of the versions from <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_19">Woolfe (no. 19)</ref> to <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_27">Hands (no. 27)</ref>, only <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_20">Payne (no. 20)</ref> is directly related to <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne (no. 21)</ref>.

Yet as important as the debate seems to be in the reading, several productions omit it. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_12">French</ref> (differing from <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>), <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_15 #item_009_16">Allen</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_22">Quayle</ref> cut exactly as <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> does (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1887" targetEnd="#tln_1916">1887–1916</ref>). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> only, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne (no. 21)</ref> cut a bit more (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1887" targetEnd="#tln_1921">1887–1921</ref>). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> cuts <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1892" targetEnd="#tln_1916">1892–1916</ref>. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_23">Wood</ref> cuts Perdita’s distaste for painted flowers and painted women (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1912" targetEnd="#tln_1916">1912–16</ref>). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> may have cut to make Perdita suitably deferential and docile for 18th-c. audiences (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_das80"><name type="app">Dash</name></ref>, 1980, p. 281); even <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> observes (p. 94) that Perdita’s <quote>modest humility</quote> is the trait that <quote>recommends the supposed shepherdess exceedingly to [the audience’s] favour.</quote> <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> defers only to the <quote>powers of his actors</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_boa1825"><name type="app">Boaden</name></ref>, 1825, 2:2)—or in this case, a lack of power—in cutting the debate completely. The <title level="j">Times</title> review of 26 Mar. 1802 reveals that <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>’s Perdita (Catherine Hicks) is attractive but almost <quote>destitute of sensibility,</quote> with a voice so weak that <quote>it is almost impossible to hear her distinctly, even at a short distance from the stage.</quote> Instead of <quote>attending to the speeches addressed to her, or the business of the scene&hellip;[Hicks] was frequently employed in adjusting her dress.</quote> In later productions, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> could and did change actresses, but he did not change his text, and productions that derive from his, as well as some that do not, deprive Perdita of much of her spirit as well as some wonderful lines. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10">Kean (no. 10)</ref> further diminish Perdita’s stage presence by cutting Florizel’s <quote>too large</quote> praise of her, and her response (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1947" targetEnd="#tln_1974">1947–74</ref>); <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_23">Wood</ref> also cuts most of these lines (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1947" targetEnd="#tln_1952">1947–52</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1959" targetEnd="#tln_1971">1959–71</ref>). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> cuts twenty-eight, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref> twenty-four lines—mostly from Florizel’s dialogue.

<head>4.4 The Aborted Betrothal and Its Results</head>

<p>Audience perception of Polixenes is affected as he moves to prevent Florizel and Perdita from a binding betrothal (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2165" targetEnd="#tln_2285">2165–285</ref>), for while Polixenes might accept the <quote>casual coupling&hellip;expected from country folk, matrimony with their betters seems out of the question</quote> (<ref targType="bibl" target="#b_coo91"><name type="app">Cook</name></ref>, 1991, p. 201), despite his stance to the contrary in the art vs. nature debate. Several stage versions reduce Polixenes’s ranting—intentionally or not, the cuts make him more consistent in his views, less violent and repugnant in his behavior—and some of them parallel the change in Polixenes with a reduction in the determination and devotion of the young lovers. Polixenes hints that Florizel missed a chance to buy Perdita’s favor when he did not buy any of Autolycus’s trinkets (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2174" targetEnd="#tln_2178">2174–8</ref>); <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_19">Woolfe</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_20 #item_009_21">Payne</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_22">Quayle</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_23">Wood</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_25">Barton</ref> cut this suggestion.

<p>Perdita has a mere seven lines in this scene (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3234" targetEnd="#tln_3238">3234–8</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3287" targetEnd="#tln_3288">3287–8</ref>), a number that could easily be handled by an understudy. This fact suggests to <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_para82"><name type="app">Partridge</name></ref> (1982, p. 4) that Sh.’s intention may have been to double the roles of Hermione and Perdita as a way of overcoming the difficulty of casting separately the roles of mother and daughter who must markedly resemble each other. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_webm42"><name type="app">Webster</name></ref> (1942, p. 282) feels that doubling does <quote>great violence to Shakespeare’s intention, and [has] nothing to recommend it save the possibility that the audience may want to see one woman star through the whole play instead of two in half the play each.</quote> Only four of the versions under consideration double the roles. Of those, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_15 #item_009_16">Allen</ref> use here a silent double, cutting <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3230" targetEnd="#tln_3250">3230–50</ref>. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_24">Nunn</ref> keeps Perdita’s first speech only, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_27">Hands</ref> two lines of it (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3237" targetEnd="#tln_3238">3237–8</ref>). Some of the versions not doubling the roles still find Perdita’s lines unimportant enough to cut: <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref> omits both little speeches, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref> the first, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_19">Woolfe</ref> the second, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> part of the first. The rest of the dialogue preceding the reanimation of Hermione (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3239" targetEnd="#tln_3305">3239–305</ref>) can be cut to save playing time. All versions except <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_17">Ames</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_20">Payne (no. 20)</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_23">Wood</ref> omit from two (<ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref>) to thirty-five (<ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne, no. 21</ref>) lines.</p>

<head>Substitutions, Transpositions, and Additions</head>

<p>A few original substitutions occur in stage versions, some affecting plot and characterization but most involving no more than a word or two employed to replace language deemed lewd, archaic, or obscure. Alterations adopted from reading editions are generally not discussed here. An exception is the substitution throughout of <quote>Bithynia</quote> for <quote>Bohemia</quote> in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_11">Kean (no. 11)</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref>. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref> alone explains his adoption of <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_han1"><name type="app">Hanmer</name></ref>’s emendation: the oracle of Delphi (Delphos in the original but changed throughout in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>) points to a period when Syracuse is the equivalent of Athens at <quote>the summit of her political prosperity [and]&hellip;assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, [then]&hellip;to connect the country known as <quote>Bohemia</quote> with an age so remote would be impossible</quote> (p. vi).</p>

<p>Additions account for the smallest body of change to the text. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne (no. 21)</ref> adds a short prologue stressing the folk-tale nature of <title level="m">WT</title>. Opening SDs in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_11">Kean (no. 11)</ref>, adopted in principle by <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref>, reflect <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>’s conception of place (Syracuse) and time (739 <hi rend="smcaps">b.c.</hi>), as well as his desire to keep the entire play free of what he believes to be disrupting anachronisms. Corbin, in preparing <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_17">Ames</ref>’s version, opens on—and sets many later scenes in—the <quote>alcove</quote>: the <quote>General Notes on Decoration,</quote> appended to the prompt copy, explain that he thinks the alcove an authentic feature of the Elizabethan stage within which locality is established at a glance by properties, the main stage being neutral ground from which the idea of locality is absent. Since Corbin believes that much of the early action of <title level="m">WT</title> is possible <quote>only when we assume the alcove appears as an apartment, removed from the main stage which thus becomes a sort of anteroom</quote> (p. 1), his handling of the text is guided by his conception of staging.</p>

<div type="level4" xml:id="div_subs_trial">
<head>3.2 The Trial</head>

<p>During her trial, Hermione details the terrible things that have been done to her. One of them is that her infant daughter has been <quote>Hal’d out to murther</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1280">1280</ref>). By transposing 3.2 and 3.3, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> shows the baby’s abandonment before the audience hears about it from Hermione. Substitutions generally offer an innocuous word for an original that might be deemed offensive: the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of Hermione’s <quote>first Fruits of my body</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1276">1276</ref>) becomes <quote>affection</quote> in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref>, <quote>our marriage</quote> in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> (but not <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_12">French</ref>) and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, <quote>my marriage</quote> in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref> (but not <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_15 #item_009_16">Allen</ref>). <quote>Strumpet</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1281">1281</ref>) becomes <quote>wanton</quote> in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_14">Anderson</ref>, though the difference seems negligible. In F, an officer of the court reads the oracle (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1313" targetEnd="#tln_1316">1313–16</ref>); <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_25">Barton</ref> distributes the lines between Dion, Cleomenes, and other courtiers and ladies, appropriately reserving the last two highly dramatic lines (the King <quote><hi rend="italic">shall liue without an Heire, if that which is lost, be not found</hi></quote>) for Paulina. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> gives her <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1317">1317</ref>, the cry of multiple lords: <quote>Now blessed be the great <hi rend="italic">Apollo</hi></quote>; <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_12">French</ref> does not follow <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> or <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_9">Burton</ref> in this. By substituting <quote>dead</quote> for the euphemistic <quote>gone</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1327">1327</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1328">1328</ref>), <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> eliminate the minor suspense that Sh. creates, but this change gives <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> a chance to let Leontes moan, at the end of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1328">1328</ref>, <quote>Oh, oh, oh!—My son!—.</quote></p>

<p>At least two versions offer additions to SDs that bear directly on the interpretation of the text. At <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1185">1185</ref> <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref> has Hermione <quote>brought in on a Lectica [defined by him as <quote>a couch for carrying persons in a lying position, from one place to another</quote>] by her Female Attendants</quote>), a matter of staging that would be incongruous if <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref> neglected to cut Hermione’s complaints about her poor treatment in childbirth. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> (though not <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_12">French</ref>) unfortunately destroys the power of the original scene, in keeping with the general subduing of Leontes’s behavior and, consequently, Paulina’s: <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> presents as nearly private what F presents as public spectacle—Paulina enters at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1358">1358</ref> to confront Leontes with news of Hermione’s death and to accuse him of being responsible for it. A line added for Leontes after <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1338">1338</ref>—<quote>Break up the court</quote>—clears the stage of trial spectators; <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> then closes the public setting (<quote><hi rend="italic">The Court of Justice</hi></quote>) on Leontes’s dismal behavior and distances him from this embarrassing performance by having him discovered in the privacy of <quote><hi rend="italic">The King’s Closet</hi>,</quote> attended by only two courtiers. In this diminished setting, before this attenuated audience, Paulina plays out her weakened role. George Ellis, stage manager for<ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10"> Kean (see no. 10)</ref>, thinks that <quote>J. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> makes what follows [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1338">1338</ref>] take place in a front scene, probably for the convenience of setting a back scene for the next</quote> scene on the seacoast of Bohemia. J. W. Cole, who marked <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>’s promptbook and often commented on <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>’s staging, crosses out Ellis’s note.</p>

<head>4.2 Polixenes’s Intervention</head>

<p>A significant reordering of material occurs in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne (no. 21)</ref> with the transposing of 4.2 (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1612" targetEnd="#tln_1666">1612–66</ref>) and 4.3 (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1667" targetEnd="#tln_1794">1667–1794</ref>). The scene with Autolycus separates the exchange at Court, in which Polixenes orders Camillo to accompany him to the Shepherd’s cottage to spy on Florizel, and the sheepshearing, at which Polixenes confronts his son. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne (no. 21)</ref> eliminates the separation of Polixenes’s scenes, though the dialogue between Florizel and Perdita is kept intact to provide the time for Camillo and Polixenes to enter at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1863">1863</ref> in disguises simple enough to be eliminated in one grand gesture at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2260">2260</ref> (in most versions). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_19">Woolfe</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_26">Eyre</ref> alter Camillo’s statement (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1617">1617</ref>) about the years of his exile: <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_26">Eyre</ref> change fifteen to sixteen, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_19">Woolfe</ref> changes to eighteen.

To make the exchange logical, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> earlier (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2312">2312</ref>) has Florizel reveal rich clothes under his shepherd’s vest, then alters F’s <quote>dis-case&hellip;boot</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2512" targetEnd="#tln_2515">2512–15</ref>) to read <quote>retire with us to the next covert, change garments with this gentleman, (thou must think there’s necessity in it) and tho’ the bargain on his side be worst, yet thou shalt have gold to boot.</quote> Finally, to emphasize the action and take Perdita into account, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_2">Bell</ref> substitutes the following for F’s <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2521" targetEnd="#tln_2543">2521–43</ref>:

<head>5.2 The Fulfillment of the Oracle</head>

<p>As several critics note, the first reunion (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3010">3010</ref> ff.) can be played without Autolycus; <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_10 #item_009_11">Kean</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_13">Calvert</ref> reassign his lines to various courtiers and have him enter later. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_22">Quayle</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_25">Barton</ref>, by contrast, increase Autolycus’s importance by letting him take credit for bringing the Shepherd and Clown to Florizel’s ship—not in soliloquy but before the courtiers leave the stage (in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_22">Quayle</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3121" targetEnd="#tln_3130">3121–30</ref> precedes Autolycus’s first line [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3010">3010</ref>]; in <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_25">Barton</ref>, <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3121" targetEnd="#tln_3128">3121–8</ref> follows the second [<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3011">3011</ref>]). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_21">Payne (no. 21)</ref>, who names the two gentlemen Cleomenes and Dion, also draws attention to Autolycus at <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3035">3035</ref> by directing that Dion <quote>anticipates [Autolycus’s] grab for Cleomenes’ pocket.</quote></p>

<p>Kemble follows <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> as the latter creates, with additions and alterations, the Clown’s idea that gentlemanly behavior must be corrupt. After the newly made <quote>gentleman</quote> says to Autolycus, <quote>Giue me thy hand</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3164">3164</ref>), he complains of finding it empty: <quote>Hast nothing in it?—Am I not a courtier?&verbar;—I must be gently consider’d.</quote> Autolycus’s earlier lines—<quote>Seest thou not the ayre of the Court, in these enfoldings? Hath not my gate in it, the measure of the Court?</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2612" targetEnd="#tln_2614">2612–14</ref>)—are then inserted into the Clown’s speech, while Autolycus replies with the Shepherd’s line from <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2688">2688</ref>, <quote>Here is what gold I have, sir.</quote></p>

<p>Sh. allows the Clown and Shepherd a small triumph over Autolycus that <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref> do not, for after the last line of the scene (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3182">3182</ref>), they let Autolycus exult: <quote>O, sweet sir!; I have brib’d him with his own money.</quote> <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_25">Barton</ref> also lets Autolycus best the Clown and Shepherd, adding SDs in which Autolycus steals their purses (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3166">3166</ref>), takes chains from their pockets (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3178">3178</ref>), pilfers their handkerchiefs (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3180">3180</ref>), and removes additional <quote>chains off their backs</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3181">3181</ref>).</p>

<p>Only in this scene do additions and alterations change the text as much as cutting does, though not necessarily for the better. <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> alters <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3236" targetEnd="#tln_3241">3236–41</ref> (<quote>Lady&hellip;dry</quote>) as follows:

<ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, aware of the popularity of <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref>’s adaptation, uses Leontes’s lines in place of <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3236" targetEnd="#tln_3246">3236–46</ref> (in which Perdita, Paulina, and Camillo all speak). <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_9">Burton</ref> marks these lines but does not indicate a cut; <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_12">French</ref> reads with <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>.</p>

<p>In fact, the <quote>errors and misconceptions</quote> of the Morgan and <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_1">Garrick</ref> adaptations, as summarized by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_das80"><name type="app">Dash</name></ref> (1980, p. 274), describe equally well the <quote>restored</quote> versions of Hull, <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>, and the other actor-managers who modeled their productions on <ref targType="item" target="#item_009_3 #item_009_5">Kemble</ref>’s for some fifty years: they <quote>cut out Leontes’ passion-wracked passages, his intense spurts of jealousy, and his arrogance.

At the very least it seems that the sometimes startling revisions and reshapings that characterize 18th- and 19th-century versions have given way to a circumspect admiration for the Shakespearean text, which still accommodates a wide—if no longer infinite—variety of interpretations.</p>

<head>Music in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title></head>

<p>By Sh.’s time songs and dances in both their popular and their sophisticated guises had become virtually indispensable complements of the spoken drama. Inheritors of many of the artistic traditions of the morality plays and interludes of preceding centuries, the dramatists of the Renaissance inevitably made use of incidental music, and they discovered that songs and even dances could heighten and sometimes transform dramatic situations.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_moo16"><name type="app">Moore</name></ref> (1916, pp. 81, 101) notes that Sh. made highly original use of music in his plays, combining a love of odd song-words and song-music with his keen sense of dramatic structure. His stage songs were of three principal kinds: ballads, popular favorites, and dramatic songs written or adapted expressly for his plays. The first two categories indicate Sh.’s familiarity with a vast popular tradition upon which he freely drew to supplement songs of his own composition. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lath08"><name type="app">Lathrop</name></ref> (1908, pp. 1–2): In Sh.’s plays <quote>snatches and scraps of song&hellip;[<hi rend="italic">2</hi>] are&hellip;like conversation.&hellip; A frequent form taken by a trivial contest of wit&hellip;is the pert application of bits of familiar songs.&hellip; Popular songs or improvisations to familiar tunes are employed as quips and jeers.&hellip; Men of vacant minds at ease troll snatches of song.&hellip; Evans [in <title level="m">Wiv.</title>] covers his fear by singing. Men who are exhilarated by drinking sing.&hellip; Fools&hellip;and mad persons betray their lightheadedness by irrelevant scraps of melody.</quote> Sh. may have read Wager’s <title level="m">The Longer Thou Livest the More Fool Thou Art</title> (1569), in which Moros sings <quote>the foot of many songs</quote> cited in a long list of incipits (ed. Benbow, ll. 70.2–101), and Sh. could also have seen Beaumont’s <title level="m">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</title> (1607) in which Old Matthew Merrythought sings almost three dozen fragments of popular songs to give point to his dialogue. In the third category, by contrast, are the song lyrics of Sh.’s own composition, of which <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_nob23"><name type="app">Noble</name></ref> (1923, p. 12) comments: <quote>It was he who first grasped all the possibilities afforded by song for forwarding the action and who made it a vital part in his dramatic scheme.</quote> Still another category, nonvocal music in the spoken drama, is most effectively displayed at the climax of <title level="m">WT</title>, when the revivification of Hermione takes place (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3306">3306</ref> ff.).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ingr66"><name type="app">Ingram</name></ref> (1966, p. 244): <quote>The second half of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> is suffused with music as the ceremonies of love and forgiveness and reconciliation are celebrated.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> (ed. 1963, p. 172): <quote>It is the singing voice in [4.3] and the first part of [4.4] which is the chief musical element</quote> in the play. <title level="m">WT</title> includes six songs to be sung by the remarkable Autolycus, four as solo songs to the accompaniment of his plucked string instrument within a 475-line section of Act 4 (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_1669" targetEnd="#tln_2144">1669–2144</ref>). Since their exuberant lyrics contain interwoven phrases and refrains drawn largely from popular folk songs and ballads, they may have been sung to popular tunes. By contrast, Autolycus is assigned a more demanding singing part in the sixth (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2118" targetEnd="#tln_2133">2118–33</ref>), which is a striking art song for three solo voices—its lyric most likely Sh.’s creation—to be sung by him in dialogue with Mopsa and Dorcas. While for <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_kni47"><name type="app">Knight</name></ref> (1947, pp. 100–1) <quote>Autolycus is a blend of burly comedian and lyrical jester,</quote> who is also (p. 101) <quote>a sweet, smooth-voiced rogue,</quote> for <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_smih72"><name type="app">Smith</name></ref> (1972, p. 109) he is <quote>more rogue than minstrel, but his merriment is the means by which the winter part of the play is transformed into the spring part.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lath08"><name type="app">Lathrop</name></ref> (1908, p. 4): <quote>Autolycus&hellip;through his songs expresses the delights of irresponsible living sweetly and perfectly.</quote> Indirectly they summon up to Polixenes no less than to a theater audience several reactions to well-known variations on the subject of amorous trifling. Quoting <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ryl34"><name type="app">Rylands</name></ref> (1934, p. 112) to the effect that Sh.’s <quote>success [with songs] lies in a fusion of the natural with the artificial,</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_ard2"><name type="app">Pafford</name></ref> (p. 173) notes that <quote>in these songs there is much more of the natural than of the artificial, much more of the traditional and unaffected singing of <quote>tavern and field</quote> and much less of <quote>delicate artifice and charming affectation</quote> than is the case with most of Shakespeare’s earlier songs.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_fryn65a"><name type="app">Frye</name></ref> (<title level="m">Perspective</title>, 1965, pp. 144–5), speaking of <title level="m">WT</title>’s pastoral society: <quote>No mysterious music is heard in this world except the ballads of Autolycus, although Autolycus complacently notes the Orpheus-like influence of his songs [quotes <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2484" targetEnd="#tln_2486">2484–6</ref>]. But it is music that awakens Hermione in another area of the [<hi rend="italic">145</hi>] natural society, the chapel of Paulina.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_melw65"><name type="app">Mellers</name></ref> (1965, pp. 136–52) regards the country dances of shepherds and shepherdesses in <title level="m">WT</title> no less than the ceremonial courtly dances in the more sophisticated contexts of Sh.’s earlier comedies as representing <quote>human togetherness</quote> (p. 137) through their patterned steps and turns. They thus could be seen as providing an artistic picture of the well-ordered society whose members sustain their existences creatively and harmoniously through their social interchanges. For him (p. 152) <quote>the song speech is the drama of the personal life; the dance music is the communal values of the public life.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bria81"><name type="app">Brissenden</name></ref> (1981, p. 76): <quote>Dancing is&hellip;associated with harmony as it had been in the comedies but it is now also related to discord.&hellip; By this connection with both concord and disorder the dance contributes to the distinctive tone of the play, in which the apparently tragic is transmuted into a state that, while not always of serene and utter joy, nevertheless holds optimistic promise for the future.</quote> For Renaissance attitudes to social dancing, see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_how96"><name type="app">Howard</name></ref> (1996, pp. 33–44).</p>

<p>Following the early work of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grej1884"><name type="app">Greenhill</name></ref> et al. (1884), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goo91"><name type="app">Gooch</name> &amp; <name type="app">Thatcher</name></ref> (1991, 3:1908–61) describe the incidental music for <title level="m">WT</title>, dating from the late Elizabethan and the early Jacobean periods up to the present, and list the depositories in which a number of these items can be found. There are 490 listed under five main headings, the most comprehensive entitled simply <quote>Incidental Music.</quote> Theater directors reviewing the lists of surviving <title level="m">WT</title> scores from the 20th c. alone will perhaps be surprised to discover that on rare occasions eminent composers have contributed settings, including Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (for a 1935 Vienna production), Darius Milhaud (Paris, 1950), and Aram Khachaturian (Erevan, USSR, 1956). In many instances their settings, surviving sometimes in print, sometimes only in manuscript, are available for examination and presumably for use, though whether they were copyrighted <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_goo91"><name type="app">Gooch</name> &amp; <name type="app">Thatcher</name></ref> do not always say. Among such recognizable names, however, are those of dozens of lesser known music devisers and arrangers whose contributions have often attained remarkable dramatic effectiveness.</p>

</p>

<p>As for the music itself, we provide transcriptions below of settings that could have been heard in Sh.’s own day. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_senp67"><name type="app">Seng</name></ref> (1967, pp. xi–xii) comments on the discovery since 1900 of <quote>a surprising amount of new material. As a result, modern producers and stage directors [<hi rend="italic">xii</hi>] can now avail themselves of reasonably authentic melodies; and rather than regarding the songs in Shakespeare’s play as mere divertissements from the dramatic action, they can begin to regard them as integral parts of the plays.</quote> Of the ten songs and dances in <title level="m">WT</title>, five (nos. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_1">1</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_2">2</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_3">3</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_6">6</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_8">8</ref>) are solos sung by Autolycus; one (no. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_7">7</ref>) is the trio he shares with the girls. Five (nos. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_1">1</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_2">2</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_3">3</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_5">5</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_8">8</ref>) have ditties cast as quatrains whose marked anapestic movement in all but the first spells out an almost inevitable metrical complement for each in 6/4 or 6/8 time. Appended to one of these (no. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_6">6</ref>) is the extended burden of a pedlar hawking the feminine adornments he has for sale, but for another (no. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_5">5</ref>) only the closing climactic line of its quatrain survives (<quote>Whoop, doe me no harme good man</quote>), reported by the Shepherd’s servant as he informs the Clown that the wide range of the prettiest love-songs which Autolycus has in his repertory includes one whose burden makes a maid to answer with this phrase to keep <quote>some stretch-mouth’d Rascall</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2021">2021</ref>) at bay. Fortunately the entire tune for the quatrain has survived under the title of its final line, but not with its preceding lines, which may have described an offensive assault. All five were presumably intended to be set to traditional popular broadside ballad tunes, and such tunes are here transcribed as settings to enable listeners no less than performers of today to realize how the nature of a performance of this play in the dramatist’s own day could be essentially re-created in our own. (See <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref>, 1982, no. 398 n.)</p>

<p>Complementing these five songs are two relatively extended and sophisticated lyrics (nos. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_6">6</ref> and <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_7">7</ref>) also sung by Autolycus, and their surviving tunes are apparently original settings by composers of Sh.’s day. The special setting for the first of these two lyrics, demanding no little artistry from the vocalist, is preserved in the printed songs of John Wilson (1595–1677), who late in his career was the learned Doctor of Music at Oxford but who in his younger years was actively engaged in writing music for the stage and even performing it there. The second of these two—<quote>Get you hence</quote>—is a dialogue song, a more complicated type usually scored for two or three singers whose interchanges sometimes verge on the melodramatic. The lyric of this highly dramatic seventh was presumably written by Sh. for this play and its surviving setting probably devised by Robert Johnson, a composer of several stage songs of the period.</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warj57"><name type="app">Ward</name></ref> (1957) deals with the process of compiling ballad tunes of the late 16th and early 17th centuries for the lyrics mentioned by title in <title level="m">A Handefull of pleasant delites</title> (1584). He shows that modern eds. of Sh.’s lyrics for singing must recognize that while several Elizabethan and Jacobean ballad tunes may each at first have been a specifically composed setting for a particular poetic text, many such musical settings were subsequently used by dramatists as well as by performers seeking satisfactory musical frames for other lyrics. When Richard Jones printed the texts of <quote>sundrie new sonets and delectable Histories</quote> in <title level="m">A Handefull</title>, he included no music, but the modern editor of that collection, Hyder Rollins, cites the tune that he thinks is needed for an individual lyric’s presentation. All <title level="m">Handefull</title> tunes that achieved some measure of distinction are examples of such <foreign xml:lang="de" rend="italic">Gebrauchsmusik</foreign> or, as 16th-c. Italians called comparable pieces, <foreign xml:lang="it" rend="italic">arie per cantar</foreign>, <quote>airs for singing,</quote> appropriate to any poetry having the requisite meter and stanzaic form. Sh.’s lyrics are here provided with contemporaneous rather than later settings, for even those of the mid-17th c. display a considerable difference in popular music styles from those prevalent in Sh.’s lifetime.</p>

<p>The standard sources of the broadside ballad tunes of Sh.’s day are <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chaw1859"><name type="app">Chappell</name></ref> (1859), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_woo1893"><name type="app">Wooldridge</name></ref> (1893), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sim66"><name type="app">Simpson</name></ref> (1966). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warj67"><name type="app">Ward</name></ref> (1967) amplifies the new material <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_woo1893"><name type="app">Wooldridge</name></ref> brought to light. To these collections may be added the facsimiles (1961) of <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_ravt61"><name type="app">Ravenscroft</name>’s <title level="m">Pammelia</title> (1609), <title level="m">Deuteromelia</title> (1609), and <title level="m">Melismata</title> (1611)</ref>, three collections of popular music largely for the theater. Many such familiar tunes would naturally have been in the repertory of Autolycus, who might accompany himself on a lute; although the play does not mention his doing so, the one of his seven songs most recently recovered (no. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_7">7</ref> below) includes a lute accompaniment for its vocal score. All six settings—excluding, of course, <quote>Whoop, doe me no harme good man</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2023" targetEnd="#tln_2025">2023–5</ref>), a lyric outcry merely mentioned as being in his repertory—doubtless were self-accompanied. Dialogue songs also are often represented in <title level="m">Melismata</title>. The piece sung by Autolycus conversing with Dorcas and Mopsa—<quote>Get you hence</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2118" targetEnd="#tln_2133">2118–33</ref>)—would have prompted a complex special setting, presumably an assignment for a composer for the theater like Robert Johnson or John Wilson.</p>

<p>The three items of nonvocal instrumental music (nos. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_4">4</ref>, <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_9">9</ref>, and <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_10">10</ref>) are all instrumental dances scored for treble and bassus, pieces which appear in short scores in the first two sections of British Museum Additional MS 10,444, a famous collection of dance music for the English court masque compiled late in the Jacobean period by Sir Nicholas L’Estrange. Virtually all the significant masque dances are transcribed in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref> (1982) from this source, together with many of their contemporaneous cognate versions from other sources. The two-part settings for treble and bassus which appear in Add. MS 10,444 are especially useful for performances requiring short score arrangements, such as the dances in <title level="m">WT</title>.</p>

<p>Since the tune entitled <quote>The Shepherds’ Dance,</quote> which appears in Add. MS 10, 444 as no. 118, possesses the spirited flavor of a piece that might originally have been used for the dance of the Arcadians in Jonson’s <title level="m">Pan’s Anniversary</title> (1620), it has been suggested by J. P. Cutts and others as the ideal setting for <quote>A Daunce of Shepheards and Shephearddesses</quote> (no. <ref targType="item" target="#item_010_4">4</ref>) in <title level="m">WT</title>. However, a more suitable choice may be the piece entitled <quote>The Maypole</quote> (no. 123), the treble on fol. 37<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and the bassus on fol. 86<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, since, after an extended opening episode featuring an entire group of dancers, its contrasting and constantly shifting strains from duple to triple rhythm and back again more fittingly underscore the contrasting pairs of dancers—a May Lord and a May Lady, a country clown and a country wench, and, leading them, a host and a hostess—and even solo figures are given an opportunity to display aspects of their particular callings. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warj86"><name type="app">Ward</name></ref> (1986), discussing the widespread use in the contemporary drama of <quote>the national dance of England,</quote> the morris, shows a family of musical variants branching from a common <quote>morris tune.</quote> <quote>One such branch, possibly the first to establish its independence, is <quote>Staines Morris</quote></quote> (p. 303); <quote>The Maypole</quote> belongs to another. To <quote>The Maypole</quote> here are added two short pieces both entitled <quote>Staynes Morris,</quote> the first in William Ballet’s Lute Book from Trinity College, Dublin (MS D.1.21/1), and the second from <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_plaj1651"><name type="app">Playford</name></ref> (1651, p. 87). Each of these two, after an opening company dance, may be used for short, separate dances of individual duos. <quote>The Maypole</quote> was originally used for the second antimasque of Francis Beaumont’s <title level="m">Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn</title> and then possibly for the dance in the outdoor scene of <title level="m">The Two Noble Kinsmen</title> (3.3), each of which features a dramatic episode providing a description of a group of company dancers followed by a series of pairs of participants who essentially serve as counterparts to the various pairs subsequently seen in action in <title level="m">WT</title> 4.4. And likewise, no. 150 in Add. MS 10,444, entitled simply <quote>A Masque,</quote> also presents musical characteristics especially effective for underscoring the awakening of Hermione in 5.3.</p>

<p>For two of these three nonvocal compositions, suitable settings are available in four and five parts for a company of instruments, chiefly strings. <anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0007-a"/>The expense accounts from the Pell Order Book (as recorded in C.

Simpson, eds., <title level="m">Ben Jonson</title>, 10:521) for the <quote>Satyrs’ Dance</quote> and related music pieces first used in <title level="m">Oberon</title> attribute its two-part setting to Robert Johnson and its four-part setting to Thomas Lupo (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref>, 1982, nos. 107, 249).<anchor type="xref" xml:id="anchor_0007-b"/> The two-part setting for treble and bassus, from British Library Add. MS. 10,444, is included here. While the surviving contemporary five-part setting for <quote>The Maypole</quote> appearing in Wilhelm Brade’s <title level="m">Newe Ausserlesene liebliche Branden</title> (1617) and not included here expands the simple treble and bassus parts of Add. MS 10,444, it does so needlessly, since the morris dance was often performed outdoors to music traditionally provided simply by a piper and a taborer, and this accompaniment was ordinarily embellished by the tiny bells attached to the costumes as well as to the limbs of the dancers. These jingling bells were frequently tuned to harmonize with each other. Since the third of the items included here from Add. MS 10,444—the short piece entitled simply <quote>A Masque</quote> to accompany the awakening of Hermione in 5.3—consists solely of a version for treble and bassus, two additional inner parts have been editorially provided here in the event that for this quieter indoor setting a string quartet could be used to provide a contrast to the music of the preceding outdoor scenes. The whole of the two sections of Add. MS 10,444, consisting of Jacobean masque and antimasque dances, has been transcribed and edited in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref> (1982).</p>

<p>Music: Because a dance in Jonson’s masque <title level="m">Oberon</title> may reappear in <title level="m">WT</title> (see <ptr targType="anchor" target="#anchor_0023-a" targetEnd="#anchor_0023-b"/>), the manuscript in which it is found, Add.

Hence, <quote>The Maypole</quote> is transcribed here from it, in treble and bassus parts only, found respectively on fol. 35<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and fol. 85<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>.

<p>The earliest known setting, for three voices, appears in John Wilson’s <title level="m">Cheerfull Ayres or Ballads</title> (1660, sigs. L4<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>–K1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>). The transcript given here of <quote>Lawne as white</quote> joins together in a compact setting its three voice parts—the Cantus Primus and Secundus with the Bassus supported by a bass viol part. It is set a minor third below that of Wilson’s lyric text on the assumption that the melody in middle voice range would best suit most actors assigned the Autolycus role. A lute accompaniment may easily be devised from the three voice parts. Facsimiles of the Cantus Primus appear in <ref targType="bibl" target="#s_v1898"><name type="app">Furness</name></ref> (ed. 1898, pp. 388–9) and in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lonj61"><name type="app">Long</name></ref> (1961, pp. 142–3).

<p>In this dialogue song, which is set to a tune in the play called <quote>Two Maids Wooing a Man</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2110" targetEnd="#tln_2111">2110–11</ref>), the complexity of scoring has required a setting for alternating voices in rapid interchange far more demanding in ingenuity than that provided by the usual workaday ballad tune. What clearly seems to be the original music, composed probably by Robert Johnson, was discovered by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cut59"><name type="app">J. P. Cutts</name></ref> in the New York Public Library MS Drexel 4175, a mid-17th c. MS designated as <quote>Anne Twice Her Booke.</quote> Robert Johnson’s association with the King’s Men is well established, and the two dances listed below as Nos. 9a and 9b, both of which were introduced in <title level="m">Oberon</title>, appear to be his work. Words and music for this song are found in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cut56c"><name type="app">Cutts</name></ref> (<title level="a">Setting,</title> 1956, and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cut59">1959, pp. 17–18)</ref>. There is a fragmentary version of the same song for three voices in Drexel MS 4041 (fols. 127–9); this second version is also in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cut59"><name type="app">Cutts</name></ref> (1959, p. 19). <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_senp67"><name type="app">Seng</name></ref> (1967, p. 244), noting at least six errors in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cut54"><name type="app">Cutts</name></ref>’s transcripts, points to a more reliable edition by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_spi61"><name type="app">Spink</name></ref> (1961, pp. 62–3), reprinted in <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_org1996"><name type="app">Orgel</name></ref> (ed. 1996, pp. 279–81), and an edition by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lonj61"><name type="app">Long</name></ref> (1961, pp. 82–3), who also provides a facsimile of the Drexel 4175 version. The fragmentary version of Drexel 4041 includes a second stanza that may have been part of Autolycus’s original song. Autolycus implies that his rendition is incomplete, for he later says: <quote>Wee’l haue this song out anon by our selues</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2134">2134</ref>).</p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_jor86"><name type="app">Jorgens</name></ref> (1987, vols. 9, 10) reproduces in facsimile the two early 17th-c. settings of this song. Drexel 4175, item lix, is set in D minor with lute accompaniment scored for three alternating voices in successive bass and treble clefs over an unfigured bass enclosing a text of one stanza. In its present transcript, Version 1, the lyric text from Drexel 4175 appears under the lyric from <siglum>F1</siglum>. Drexel 4175 reads <hi rend="italic">vow’de</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sworne</hi> in <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2131">2131</ref> and <ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2132">2132</ref> where <siglum>F1</siglum> reads <hi rend="italic">sworne</hi> in both. Drexel 4041, here transcribed as Version 2, is set in C minor, and the twelve tetrameter lines in each of two stanzas are given completely, the second verse following at the close of the first. The last line in each verse, intended to be sung as a part song by the trio, is appropriately spaced, the text for the unlabeled Treble 1 (for Mopsa) being placed over that of similarly unlabeled Treble 2 (for Dorcas), and both over the lyric text for the bass vocalist. For some reason the copyist extends his musical notation only to the middle of measure 17 of the 26 measures comprising the whole dialogue, and the words of the lyric alone continue for the last four lines of the twelve. The placement of the words of the final line of the lyric for each voice part—those for Voices 2 and 3 being immediately beneath those for Voice 1—makes it clear that the original consisted of a duo for Verse 1 and a trio of voices in the last line of Verse 2. Suitable musical notation for the last 10 measures is here supplied editorially, in brackets; it is derived from Version 1 with appropriate adjustment of key and time values. Virtually all dialogue songs conclude with a duo if not a trio, and for the inner voice in the closing measures a suitable part has been supplied here.</p>

<p>The original tune for Autolycus’s final song has come to light in relatively recent times. The earliest setting given by <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_grej1884"><name type="app">Greenhill</name></ref> et al. (1884, p. 75) seems to be one by William Boyce (1710–79), composed about 1769 and reprinted in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_linw1816"><name type="app">Linley</name></ref> (1816, 1:29). There is an anonymous setting in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cau1864"><name type="app">Caulfield</name></ref> (1864?, 2:58–9) that might conceivably be one of the traditional stage versions which <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cau1864"><name type="app">Caulfield</name></ref> says he is collecting. If so, his setting may be even earlier than the one by Boyce, but <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_cau1864"><name type="app">Caulfield</name></ref> is not, as <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_senp67"><name type="app">Seng</name></ref> (1967, p. xi) points out, a reliable editor. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_lonj61"><name type="app">Long</name></ref> (1961, p. 85) has set the song to a contemporary tune, <quote>Sellenger’s Round</quote> (see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_woo1893"><name type="app">Wooldridge</name>, 1893, 1:256–8</ref>).</p>

<p>To these popular tunes may be added from Thomas Ravenscroft’s <title level="m">Pammelia</title> (1609) the setting for item 74, whose general title, <quote>A Round of three Country dances in one,</quote> indicates that the whole consists of three dances joined with a Basse or Ground, which can serve each of the three. The Cantus, the Medius, and the Tenor may be performed individually with the Basse or Ground, or presumably together as a piece for <quote>4 <hi rend="italic">Voc</hi>.</quote> Each of the three has an individual text. That of the Medius part, which has been named <quote>The Cramp,</quote> has long been identified and discussed by the principal editors of popular ballad and dance tunes: see <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chaw1859"><name type="app">Chappell</name></ref> (1859, p. 89), <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_woo1893"><name type="app">Wooldridge</name></ref> (1893, 1:143–4), and <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sim66"><name type="app">Simpson</name></ref> (1966, pp. 138–9). The sentiments of its lyric text, beginning <quote>[The] crampe is in my purse full sore,</quote> are very much like those of Autolycus as he sings of money as <quote>a medler</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2143">2143</ref>), and the jaunty tune in 6/4 time serves as a fitting vehicle to express his views. For fuller details see also <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_warj67"><name type="app">Ward</name></ref> (1967, p. 35), and for another early appearance Wilhelm Brade, <title level="m">Newe Ausserlesene liebliche Branden</title> (Hamburg, 1617). The setting of the <title level="m">Pammelia</title> no. 74 Medius part here follows <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_chaw1859"><name type="app">Chappell</name></ref>.</p>

<p>(a) The setting, for treble and bassus, is from British Library Add. MS 10,444, where it is entitled <quote>The Satyrs’ Masque</quote> and attributed to Robert Johnson. The present version is reproduced from <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref> (1982, no. 118); <ref targType="bibl" target="#pw_org1996"><name type="app">Orgel</name></ref> (ed. 1996, pp. 282–3) reprints it from <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref> (1978, no. 107, pp. 209–10).</p>

<p>(b) A second setting, also entitled <quote>The Satyrs’ Masque,</quote> for consort in four parts—cantus, altus, tenor, and bassus, with bassus generalis—appears in Thomas Simpson’s <title level="m">Taffel-Consort</title> (Hamburg, 1621) as item 24, attributed to Robert Johnson. It is transcribed in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref> (1982) as no. 249. As indicated in n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2059">2164</ref>, <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bria81"><name type="app">Brissenden</name></ref> (1981, p. 92) believes that the appearance here of satyrs, who were identified with disorder and sexual licence, together with (p. 94) <quote>the trickery of Autolycus and the bawdry of the two girls,</quote> motivates Polixenes to turn on Florizel and Perdita with <quote>emotional wildness.</quote> Autolycus’s efforts to sell his wares are hardly trickery, however, and <quote>bawdry</quote> is not the word for the girls’ contention over the Clown, which has already been decided in favor of Mopsa. The love triangle is given light-hearted musical expression in the trio sung by Autolycus and the two girls (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2118" targetEnd="#tln_2133">2118–33</ref>), which is followed by Autolycus’s exit song, <quote>Will you buy any Tape?</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2139" targetEnd="#tln_2144">2139–44</ref>). The satyr dance seems unrelated except as another expression of rustic high spirits.</p>

<p>It is also held (see n. <ref targType="note_cn" target="#cn_2045">2147</ref>) that the music was composed by Robert Johnson for Ben Jonson’s masque of <title level="m">Oberon</title>, performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 as part of the celebration of Prince Henry’s investiture as Prince of Wales. Since one <quote>three</quote> of the twelve participants in <title level="a">The Satyrs’ Dance</title> <quote>hath danc’d before the king</quote> (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_2159">2159</ref>), it is thought they did so as dancers in <title level="m">Oberon</title>. These men not only may have trained the footwork of their new fellow dancers but also may have seen to it that Robert Johnson’s music was used. The recreation of an episode of a royal theatrical show would no doubt have proved a rare delight for a popular audience, but some critics are skeptical. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_bulg75"><name type="app">Bullough</name></ref> (1975, 8:115), for example: <quote>Perhaps some of Jonson’s dancers were King’s Men, and repeated their antics in Shakespeare’s play. There is no proof that Robert Johnson’s music for <title level="m">Oberon</title> was used again in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.</quote></p>

<p><ref targType="bibl" target="#b_sanw87"><name type="app">Sanders</name></ref> (1987, p. 122): <quote>At this point of exquisite equipoise, he [Sh.] summons his last resource, the metamorphic miracle-worker, music—coactive with what’s unreal, it’s true, but not in the nightmare fashion of jealous delusion. Only music can make real the unreal in a way that reintegrates it with the creative continuum, awakening, uniting, redeeming. It will be slow, halting, painful—this musical summoning of the numbed soul out of the great frost of matter—but it is the miracle of miracles.</quote> The anonymous setting entitled <quote>A Masque</quote> for treble and bassus appears in two voices in British Library Add. MS 10,444, the treble on fol. 43<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and the bassus on fol. 93<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. A modern transcript of these two parts appears in <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_saba78"><name type="app">Sabol</name></ref> (1982, no. 150). Originally used as a formal dance for an unidentified Jacobean masque, it here serves as accompaniment for a dramatic transformation scene. It consists of three strains; the opening chords of the first two strains, over which are superimposed fermatas followed by brief rapidly moving passages, supply a fitting musical response by a group of performers who have been directly ordered to waken Hermione (<ref targType="lb" target="#tln_3306">3306</ref>), and then in the third strain, which suddenly shifts to triple meter, the slow duple rhythm of the closing measures of the first strain suddenly changes to accompany even more positively this wondrous metamorphosis. <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_stef71"><name type="app">Sternfeld</name></ref> (1971, pp. 166–7): <quote>The belief that heavenly music rewards the good, punishes the bad, heals the sick, and foretells divine plans to anguished mortals operates.&hellip; On the stage this heavenly music is usually repre-[<hi rend="italic">167</hi>]sented by the soft music of strings.</quote> <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_pyl69"><name type="app">Pyle</name></ref> (1969, p. 177): <quote>In the statue scene Shakespeare gained an effect in dramatic terms comparable to that of a transformation scene in a masque, achieving the masque-inventor’s object <quote>to merge spectator and actor in a single mimetic illusion</quote></quote> (quoting <ref targType="bibl" target="#b_org65"><name type="app">Orgel</name></ref> [1965, p. 188]).</p>
